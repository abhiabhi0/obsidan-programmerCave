```go
func main() {
    a := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
    a = append(a, 5)
}
```

- `a` is a slice of integers.
- The slice `a` is initialized with the elements `1, 2, 3, 4`.
- Internally, a slice in Go is a descriptor which includes a pointer to an underlying array, the length of the slice, and its capacity.
- Here, the length and capacity of the slice `a` are both 4

- The `append` function is used to add elements to a slice.
- In this case, it appends the integer `5` to the slice `a`.
- The `append` function returns a new slice that includes the new element.
- Internally, several things can happen during this append operation:
    1. **Capacity Check**: Go checks if the existing capacity of the slice `a` is sufficient to accommodate the new element.
    2. **Capacity Sufficiency**:
        - If the capacity is sufficient, the new element `5` is added to the existing underlying array.
        - The length of the slice is increased by one, making it 5.
    3. **Insufficient Capacity**:
        - If the capacity is not sufficient (which is not the case here), Go allocates a new underlying array with a larger capacity (typically double the current capacity).
        - The elements of the original slice are copied to this new array, and then the new element is added.
        - The pointer in the slice descriptor is updated to point to this new array, and the length and capacity are adjusted accordingly.
