Preemptive scheduling is a CPU scheduling method that allows the operating system to interrupt a currently running process to allocate CPU time to a higher-priority process. This type of scheduling is essential in real-time systems where timely execution of critical tasks is necessary.

### Key Characteristics of Preemptive Scheduling:
- **Interruption**: A running process can be interrupted and moved back to the ready state if a higher-priority process becomes available. This ensures that more critical tasks can be executed promptly, improving responsiveness and system performance [1][2].
- **Context Switching**: When a higher-priority process preempts a lower-priority one, the operating system saves the context of the interrupted process so that it can resume later. This involves some overhead due to context switching [3][5].
- **Time-Slicing**: Many preemptive scheduling algorithms, such as Round Robin and Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), use time-slicing techniques to allocate fixed time slots for processes, ensuring fair CPU time distribution among all processes [2][4].

### Advantages:
- **Responsiveness**: Preemptive scheduling enhances system responsiveness by allowing high-priority tasks to execute immediately [2][4].
- **Better Resource Utilization**: It allows for more efficient use of CPU resources, as lower-priority processes do not block higher-priority ones from executing [1][5].

### Disadvantages:
- **Overhead**: The frequent context switching can lead to increased overhead, which may reduce overall system performance if not managed properly [3][5].
- **Complexity**: Implementing preemptive scheduling adds complexity to the operating system, as it must manage priorities and handle interruptions effectively [1][4].

In summary, preemptive scheduling is crucial for systems that require high responsiveness and efficient resource management, particularly in environments where multiple processes with varying priorities need to coexist.
