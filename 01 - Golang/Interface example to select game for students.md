Sure, here is a basic example of how you might create an interface in Go to allow students to select various games in a school setting:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// GameSelector interface defines the method for selecting games
type GameSelector interface {
	SelectGame() string
}

// Basketball struct represents a basketball game
type Basketball struct{}

// SelectGame method for Basketball
func (b Basketball) SelectGame() string {
	return "Basketball"
}

// Soccer struct represents a soccer game
type Soccer struct{}

// SelectGame method for Soccer
func (s Soccer) SelectGame() string {
	return "Soccer"
}

// Volleyball struct represents a volleyball game
type Volleyball struct{}

// SelectGame method for Volleyball
func (v Volleyball) SelectGame() string {
	return "Volleyball"
}

// Student struct represents a student with a name and a chosen game
type Student struct {
	Name  string
	Game  GameSelector
}

// ChooseGame method for Student to select a game
func (s *Student) ChooseGame(g GameSelector) {
	s.Game = g
}

func main() {
	// Create instances of each game
	basketball := Basketball{}
	soccer := Soccer{}
	volleyball := Volleyball{}

	// Create students
	student1 := Student{Name: "Alice"}
	student2 := Student{Name: "Bob"}
	student3 := Student{Name: "Charlie"}

	// Students select games
	student1.ChooseGame(basketball)
	student2.ChooseGame(soccer)
	student3.ChooseGame(volleyball)

	// Print out each student's chosen game
	fmt.Printf("%s selected %s\n", student1.Name, student1.Game.SelectGame())
	fmt.Printf("%s selected %s\n", student2.Name, student2.Game.SelectGame())
	fmt.Printf("%s selected %s\n", student3.Name, student3.Game.SelectGame())
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Interfaces and Structs**:
   - `GameSelector` is an interface with a method `SelectGame` that returns a string.
   - `Basketball`, `Soccer`, and `Volleyball` are structs that implement the `GameSelector` interface by defining the `SelectGame` method.

2. **Student Struct**:
   - `Student` struct has fields `Name` and `Game`. The `Game` field is of type `GameSelector`, meaning it can hold any value that implements the `GameSelector` interface.
   - `ChooseGame` method allows a `Student` to select a game by setting the `Game` field.

3. **Main Function**:
   - Instances of the games (`basketball`, `soccer`, and `volleyball`) are created.
   - Instances of students (`student1`, `student2`, and `student3`) are created with names.
   - Each student selects a game using the `ChooseGame` method.
   - The selected game for each student is printed using the `SelectGame` method from the `GameSelector` interface.

This code provides a basic demonstration of using interfaces in Go to handle different types of games and how students can select among them.
