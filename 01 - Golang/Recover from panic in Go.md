### Panic:

- A panic occurs when a Go program encounters a runtime error that it cannot recover from. This could be due to various reasons, such as division by zero, attempting to access an out-of-bounds array index, or encountering a nil pointer dereference.
- When a panic occurs, the normal flow of the program is stopped immediately, and the program starts unwinding the stack, which means it starts to undo the function calls, similar to how a stack unwinds during a function call chain.
- While unwinding the stack, deferred function calls are executed in the reverse order of their registration (LIFO order).
- If no deferred function handles the panic, the program terminates, and an error message is printed to the standard error stream.

### Recover:

- To prevent a panic from crashing the entire program, Go provides the **recover()** function.
- The **recover()** function is used in combination with the **defer** statement. When **recover()** is called inside a deferred function, it stops the panic's propagation and returns the value that was passed to the call to **panic()**.
- If **recover()** is called outside the deferred function or if it's not called at all, it will return **nil**.
- To use **recover()** effectively, you need to defer a function that includes a call to **recover()** at the beginning, and this function should be placed in the appropriate location in the call stack to capture and handle the panic.

```go
func recoverFromPanic() {
    if r := recover(); r != nil {
        fmt.Println("Recovered:", r)
    }
}
func someFunction() {
    defer recoverFromPanic() // Using defer to call the recovery function
    // Simulate a panic
    panic("Something went wrong!")
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Start")
    someFunction()
    fmt.Println("End")
}
```

### Execution Flow

1. The program starts and prints "Start".
2. `someFunction()` is called:
    - Within `someFunction()`, `recoverFromPanic()` is deferred. This means it will be called when `someFunction()` returns, regardless of whether `someFunction()` exits normally or due to a panic.
    - `panic("Something went wrong!")` is called, causing a panic and starting the stack unwinding process.
3. As the stack unwinds, the deferred `recoverFromPanic()` function is invoked:
    - `recover()` captures the panic and returns the panic value ("Something went wrong!").
    - "Recovered: Something went wrong!" is printed to the console.
    - The panic is effectively neutralized, and the program continues execution.
4. Control returns to `main()`, and "End" is printed, demonstrating that the program has recovered from the panic and continued execution.
