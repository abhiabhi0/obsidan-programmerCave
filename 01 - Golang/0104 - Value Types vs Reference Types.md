### Value Types
Value types hold their data directly. When you assign a value type to another variable, a copy of the data is made. Common value types in Go include:

- **Basic Types**: `int`, `float64`, `bool`, `string`
- **Structs**
- **Arrays**

#### Example of Value Types:

```go
var a int = 10
var b int = a // Copy is made
b = 20       // 'a' remains 10
```

In this example, `b` receives a copy of `a`. Changes to `b` do not affect `a`.

### Reference Types
Reference types hold a reference (or pointer) to the actual data. When you assign a reference type to another variable, both variables refer to the same underlying data. Common reference types in Go include:

- **Slices**
- **Maps**
- **Channels**
- **Pointers**
- **Interfaces**

#### Example of Reference Types:

```go
sliceA := []int{1, 2, 3}
sliceB := sliceA // Reference is assigned
sliceB[0] = 100  // Changes sliceA[0] to 100 as well
```

In this case, both `sliceA` and `sliceB` point to the same underlying array. Modifying one affects the other.

## Detailed Breakdown by Data Type

### 1. Basic Data Types (Value Types)
- **Behavior**: Copies are made during assignment.
- **Example**:
    ```go
    var x int = 5
    var y int = x // y is a copy of x
    ```

### 2. Structs (Value Types)
- **Behavior**: Copies are made during assignment.
- **Example**:
    ```go
    type Point struct {
        X int
        Y int
    }
    
    p1 := Point{X: 1, Y: 2}
    p2 := p1 // p2 is a copy of p1
    p2.X = 10 // p1.X remains 1
    ```

### 3. Arrays (Value Types)
- **Behavior**: Copies are made during assignment.
- **Example**:
    ```go
    arr1 := [3]int{1, 2, 3}
    arr2 := arr1 // arr2 is a copy of arr1
    arr2[0] = 100 // arr1[0] remains 1
    ```

### 4. Slices (Reference Types)
- **Behavior**: References are assigned during assignment.
- **Example**:
    ```go
    slice1 := []int{1, 2, 3}
    slice2 := slice1 // slice2 references the same underlying array as slice1
    slice2[0] = 100 // Changes slice1[0] to 100 as well
    ```

### 5. Maps (Reference Types)
- **Behavior**: References are assigned during assignment.
- **Example**:
    ```go
    map1 := map[string]int{"a": 1}
    map2 := map1 // map2 references the same map as map1
    map2["a"] = 100 // Changes map1["a"] to 100 as well
    ```

### 6. Channels (Reference Types)
- **Behavior**: References are assigned during assignment.
- **Example**:
    ```go
    ch1 := make(chan int)
    ch2 := ch1 // ch2 references the same channel as ch1
    go func() { ch2 <- 42 }()
    
    val := <-ch1 // val will receive from the same channel referenced by ch2
    ```

### 7. Interfaces (Reference Types)
- **Behavior**: Interfaces hold references to values and their types.
- **Example**:
    ```go
    var i interface{} = "hello"
    var j interface{} = i // j references the same value as i
    
    i = "world" // j still holds "hello"
    ```

## Conclusion

In summary, when assigning variables in Go:
- For value types (like basic types, structs, and arrays), a copy of the value is created.
- For reference types (like slices, maps, channels, pointers, and interfaces), a reference to the original data is assigned.

Understanding these behaviors is essential for effective memory management and avoiding unintended side effects in your Go programs.
