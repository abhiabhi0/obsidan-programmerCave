### Example Function

Let's create a simple function called `processNumbers` that simulates processing numbers. It will take a `WaitGroup` to signal when it's done and a channel to send processed results.

#### Function Implementation

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

// processNumbers processes numbers from the input slice and sends the results to the output channel.
// It uses a WaitGroup to signal when processing is complete.
func processNumbers(numbers []int, wg *sync.WaitGroup, results chan<- int) {
	defer wg.Done() // Decrement the WaitGroup counter when the function completes
	defer close(results)

	for _, number := range numbers {
		// Simulate some processing (e.g., squaring the number)
		results <- number * number
	}
}

func main() {
	// Example usage
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	results := make(chan int)

	numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
	wg.Add(1)

	go processNumbers(numbers, &wg, results)

	for result := range results {
		fmt.Println(result) // Output processed results
	}

	wg.Wait()

}
```

### Unit Test Case

Now let's write a unit test for the `processNumbers` function. We will use the `testing` package and check if the output matches our expectations.

#### Unit Test Implementation

```go
package main

import (
	"sync"
	"testing"
)

func TestProcessNumbers(t *testing.T) {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	results := make(chan int)

	numbers := []int{1, 2, 3}
	wg.Add(1)

	go processNumbers(numbers, &wg, results)

	expectedResults := map[int]bool{
		1: true,
		4: true,
		9: true,
	}

	for result := range results {
		if !expectedResults[result] {
			t.Errorf("Unexpected result: got %d, want one of %v", result, expectedResults)
		}
		delete(expectedResults, result) // Remove found result from expectedResults
	}

	if len(expectedResults) > 0 {
		t.Errorf("Missing expected results: %v", expectedResults)
	}

	wg.Wait()

}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Function `processNumbers`**:
   - Takes a slice of integers (`numbers`), a pointer to a `sync.WaitGroup`, and a channel for sending processed results.
   - It squares each number and sends it to the `results` channel.
   - Calls `wg.Done()` to indicate that this goroutine has finished processing.

2. **Unit Test `TestProcessNumbers`**:
   - Initializes a `sync.WaitGroup` and a channel for results.
   - Starts the `processNumbers` function in a goroutine.
   - Uses an anonymous goroutine to wait for completion and close the results channel.
   - Checks the received results against expected squared values using a map for quick lookups.
   - Reports any unexpected or missing results.

### Running the Unit Test

To run the unit test, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go test -v
```

This will execute your tests and provide detailed output about their success or failure. 

With this setup, you have both a functional example of using goroutines with channels and wait groups in Go, as well as a robust unit test to verify its correctness.
