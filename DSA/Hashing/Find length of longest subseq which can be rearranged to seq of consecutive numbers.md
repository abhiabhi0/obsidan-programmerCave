To find the **length of the longest subsequence that can be rearranged into a sequence of consecutive numbers**, the approach involves identifying the smallest element in a potential sequence and expanding from there. Here's how it works:

### Key Insights:

1. **Finding the Start of a Sequence:**
    
    - A number xx is the start of a sequence if x−1x-1 is not present in the array. This ensures that xx is the smallest element in its consecutive sequence.
2. **Expanding the Sequence:**
    
    - Once the start of a sequence is identified, keep checking for x+1,x+2,…x+1, x+2, \dots, incrementing the count until a number is not found.
3. **Using a Set:**
    
    - Storing elements in a set allows for O(1)O(1) lookup, which makes it efficient to check if a number exists while expanding the sequence.
4. **Optimization:**
    
    - By starting only at numbers that are the beginning of a sequence, we avoid unnecessary computations for elements that are part of a longer sequence already processed.

### Algorithm:

1. Insert all elements of the array into a set.
2. Initialize a variable `max_length` to track the length of the longest sequence.
3. For each element in the array:
    - Check if element−1\text{element} - 1 exists in the set.
    - If not, this element is the start of a new sequence.
    - Expand the sequence by checking for element+1,element+2,…\text{element} + 1, \text{element} + 2, \dots, updating the length.
    - Update `max_length` if the current sequence length is greater.
4. Return `max_length`.

### Code (Python):

```python
def longest_consecutive_subsequence(arr):
    num_set = set(arr)
    max_length = 0

    for num in arr:
        # Check if num is the start of a sequence
        if num - 1 not in num_set:
            current_num = num
            current_length = 1

            # Expand the sequence
            while current_num + 1 in num_set:
                current_num += 1
                current_length += 1

            # Update max_length
            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)

    return max_length


# Example
arr = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
print(longest_consecutive_subsequence(arr))  # Output: 4 (sequence: [1, 2, 3, 4])
```

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Input:

`arr = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]`

#### Steps:

1. **Insert into Set:**
    
    - `num_set = {100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2}`
2. **Processing Elements:**
    
    - For `100`:
        - 100-1 \not\in \text{num_set}, start sequence.
        - Sequence: [100][100], length = 1.
    - For `4`:
        - 4-1 \not\in \text{num_set}, start sequence.
        - Sequence: [4][4], length = 1.
    - For `200`:
        - 200-1 \not\in \text{num_set}, start sequence.
        - Sequence: [200][200], length = 1.
    - For `1`:
        - 1-1 \not\in \text{num_set}, start sequence.
        - Sequence: [1,2,3,4][1, 2, 3, 4], length = 4.
    - For `3` and `2`:
        - Skip since they are part of the sequence starting at `1`.
3. **Result:**
    
    - Longest sequence length = 4.

### Complexity:

1. **Time Complexity:**
    
    - O(N)O(N), where NN is the size of the array.
    - Each element is processed once, and set operations (insertion, lookup) take O(1)O(1).
2. **Space Complexity:**
    
    - O(N)O(N) for the set.

### Extensions:

- **Finding the Sequence:** Modify the code to store the sequence if required:
    
    ```python
    def find_longest_consecutive_subsequence(arr):
        num_set = set(arr)
        max_length = 0
        best_sequence = []
    
        for num in arr:
            if num - 1 not in num_set:
                current_num = num
                current_sequence = []
    
                while current_num in num_set:
                    current_sequence.append(current_num)
                    current_num += 1
    
                if len(current_sequence) > max_length:
                    max_length = len(current_sequence)
                    best_sequence = current_sequence
    
        return best_sequence
    
    
    # Example
    arr = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
    print(find_longest_consecutive_subsequence(arr))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    ```
    

This approach ensures correctness while being highly efficient for large datasets.
