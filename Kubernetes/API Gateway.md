The API gateway pattern is a common architectural pattern in which an [API gateway](https://www.solo.io/topics/api-gateway/) sits between the client and a collection of microservices. The API gateway acts as a single entry point for clients to access the microservices, allowing clients to interact with the microservices as if they were a single service. 

The API gateway can perform tasks such as authentication, rate limiting, and caching to improve the performance and security of the microservices. This pattern is often used in microservice-based architectures to help manage and route requests to the various microservices.

## When to use the API gateway pattern

There are several situations in which the API gateway pattern can be useful:

- **When you have a microservice architecture:** If you have a system that is built using microservices, an API gateway can be used to route requests from clients to the appropriate backend service and then return the service’s response back to the client.
- **When you need to expose your backend services to external clients:** An API gateway can be used to expose your backend services to external clients over the internet, while still keeping the backend services protected and secure.
- **When you need to add additional functionality:** An API gateway can provide additional functionality, such as request routing, load balancing, caching, and authentication, which can be useful if you want to add these capabilities to your system.
- **When you need to hide the complexity of your backend services:** An API gateway can hide the complexity of the backend services from the client, making the client’s code simpler and easier to maintain.

## **Centralized Entry Point**

The **API Gateway** serves as a single entry point to the whole application (such as web or mobile applications) for the client to access the system. Through the entry point, the client can communicate with all the individual microservices as the **API Gateway** handles the routes for the microservices instead of the client. This makes the communication between the client and the application simple through a single route regardless of the complexity of the microservice architecture. Furthermore, it keeps the application prone to adding new microservices as the route for the client does not add up or differ.

## Request Routing

Since all requests come to the single entry point where **API Gateway** is, it serves the router for the other microservice points. It happens through the identification of a certain microservice endpoint that is being requested by the client depending on the request details such as request URL, HTTP methods, headers, or any other parameters, and forwards the request to the corresponding destination.

## Authentication and Authorization

Handling authentication and authorization at the **API Gateway** level provides a centralized and efficient way to manage security concerns. It authenticates incoming requests by the client using techniques such as API keys, OAuth or JWT tokens, and so on. Furthermore, it can ensure to implementation client’s role-based authorities by providing access to the microservices only that the client is authorized to access.

## Monitoring and Analytics

The **API Gateway** can gather logs and metrics regarding incoming client requests and application responses. Then provides valuable insights into the system performance, allowing to identify usage of patterns and potential issues in the application. Through that existing problems can be detected and diagnosed in real-time ensuring the reliability and availability of the system. Furthermore, it helps to monitor every single microservice independently for their performance from a single point.
