Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform originally developed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It ==automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications==. Here are some key aspects of Kubernetes:

1. **[[Container Orchestration]]**:
   - Kubernetes allows you to manage and coordinate the deployment of containerized applications across a cluster of machines, abstracting away the underlying infrastructure.

2. **Declarative Configuration**:
   - Kubernetes uses YAML or JSON configuration files to describe the desired state of your application. You specify what you want to deploy, and Kubernetes takes care of making it happen.

3. **Scaling and Self-healing**:
   - Kubernetes can automatically scale your application based on resource usage or user-defined metrics using Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA). It can also restart containers that fail, replace containers, kill containers that don't respond to your user-defined health check, and more, ensuring high availability and resilience.

4. **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**:
   - Kubernetes provides built-in mechanisms for service discovery and load balancing. Services abstract away individual pod instances and provide a stable endpoint for accessing your application.

5. **Storage Orchestration**:
   - Kubernetes offers various options for persistent storage, including local storage, network-attached storage (NAS), and cloud-specific storage solutions. It enables you to dynamically provision storage resources and attach them to your pods.

6. **Secrets and Configuration Management**:
   - Kubernetes provides a secure way to store sensitive information such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys using Secrets. It also supports ConfigMaps for storing non-sensitive configuration data.
   - Ref [[Secrets in Kubernetes]]

7. **Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Cloud Support**:
   - Kubernetes is cloud-agnostic and can run on any public cloud (like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or Azure), on-premises, or even on bare-metal servers. This flexibility allows you to build applications that can easily be migrated between different environments.

8. **Extensibility and Ecosystem**:
   - Kubernetes has a rich ecosystem of third-party tools, plugins, and extensions that extend its functionality. These include monitoring and logging solutions, networking plugins (CNI), service meshes (like Istio), and more.

Overall, Kubernetes simplifies the deployment and management of containerized applications, allowing developers to focus on building their applications rather than managing the underlying infrastructure. It has become the de facto standard for container orchestration and is widely adopted in both small startups and large enterprises.
