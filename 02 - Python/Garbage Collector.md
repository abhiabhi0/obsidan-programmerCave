Pythonâ€™s memory allocation and deallocation method is automatic.

Python uses a **reference counting** system along with a cyclic garbage collector to handle memory management. Reference counting keeps track of the number of references to an object, and when the count drops to zero, the memory occupied by that object can be reclaimed.

The behavior of the Python garbage collector can be summarized as follows:

1. **Reference Counting**: Python employs reference counting as its primary method of memory management. Each object in memory has a reference count, which keeps track of the number of references to that object. When an object's reference count drops to zero, meaning there are no more references to it, the memory occupied by that object is reclaimed immediately.

2. **Cyclic Garbage Collection**: While reference counting efficiently handles most cases of memory management, it struggles with circular references. Circular references occur when two or more objects reference each other in a loop, preventing their reference counts from dropping to zero even when they are not reachable from the main program. To address this issue, Python utilizes a cyclic garbage collector. This collector periodically scans the memory to identify and collect circularly referenced objects, allowing their memory to be reclaimed.

3. **Automatic Operation**: The garbage collector operates automatically in the background, without requiring explicit intervention from the developer. It kicks in when necessary to reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use.

4. **Generational Collection**: Python's garbage collector utilizes a generational approach to improve efficiency. Objects are divided into different generations based on their age, with younger objects being more likely to become garbage sooner. The garbage collector focuses its efforts on younger generations more frequently, while older generations are collected less frequently.

5. **Impact on Performance**: While the garbage collector is essential for managing memory and preventing memory leaks, it can also have a slight impact on performance. The periodic scanning and collection process consume CPU resources, although modern implementations of Python have optimized the garbage collector to minimize this impact.

Overall, the Python garbage collector efficiently manages memory allocation and deallocation, ensuring that programs run smoothly without exhausting system resources. Developers typically do not need to interact directly with the garbage collector, but understanding its behavior can help optimize memory usage in Python applications.
