### 1. Range-Based Sharding: 
Splitting your data into distinct ranges. Think of it as organizing your books by genre on separate shelves.

### 2. Key-Based Sharding (with a dash of %3 hash): 
Imagine each piece of data having a unique key, and we distribute them based on a specific rule. It's like sorting your playing cards by suit and number.

### Directory-Based Sharding: 
A directory, like a phone book, helps you quickly find the information you need. Similarly, this technique uses a directory to route data efficiently.
