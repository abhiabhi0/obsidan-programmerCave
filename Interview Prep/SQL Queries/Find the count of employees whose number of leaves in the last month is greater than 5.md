You can write a query to find the count of employees whose number of leaves in the last month is greater than 5. The query assumes you have a table structure like this:

### Table: `employee_leaves`

|**Column Name**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`employee_id`|Unique ID of the employee|
|`leave_date`|Date when the employee took leave|
|`leave_type`|Type of leave (optional)|

---

### SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT employee_id) AS employee_count
FROM employee_leaves
WHERE leave_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH) AND LAST_DAY(DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH))
GROUP BY employee_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

---

### Explanation:

1. **`DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)`**:
    
    - Subtracts 1 month from the current date to get the first day of the last month.
2. **`LAST_DAY(DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH))`**:
    
    - Finds the last day of the previous month.
3. **`COUNT(*)`**:
    
    - Counts the number of leave entries per employee.
4. **`HAVING COUNT(*) > 5`**:
    
    - Filters employees with more than 5 leave entries in the last month.
5. **`COUNT(DISTINCT employee_id)`**:
    
    - Counts the number of unique employees who meet the condition.

---

### Sample Output:

|**employee_count**|
|---|
|42|

This result indicates that 42 employees took more than 5 leaves in the last month.
