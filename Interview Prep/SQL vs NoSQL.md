| 1)    | Databases are categorized as Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).                          | NoSQL databases are categorized as Non-relational or distributed database system.                                                                           |
| 2)    | SQL databases have fixed or static or predefined schema.                                             | NoSQL databases have dynamic schema.                                                                                                                        |
| 3)    | SQL databases display data in form of tables so it is known as table-based database.                 | NoSQL databases display data as collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores.                                             |
| 4)    | SQL databases are vertically scalable.                                                               | NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.                                                                                                                  |
| 5)    | SQL databases use a powerful language "Structured Query Language" to define and manipulate the data. | In NoSQL databases, collection of documents are used to query the data. It is also called unstructured query language. It varies from database to database. |
| 6)    | SQL databases are best suited for complex queries.                                                   | NoSQL databases are not so good for complex queries because these are not as powerful as SQL queries.                                                       |
| 7)    | SQL databases are not best suited for hierarchical data storage.                                     | NoSQL databases are best suited for hierarchical data storage.                                                                                              |
| 8)    | MySQL, Oracle, Sqlite, PostgreSQL and MS-SQL etc. are the example of SQL database.                   | MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDB, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j, CouchDB etc. are the example of nosql database                                                  |
