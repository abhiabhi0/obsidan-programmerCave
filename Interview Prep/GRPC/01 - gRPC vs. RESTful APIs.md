Both gRPC and RESTful APIs allow different parts of a system to talk to each other. Here's how they differ:

---
### Key Differences (Simplified)

1. **Protocol and Data Format**    
    - **gRPC**: Uses **Protocol Buffers** (Protobuf), which converts data into a compact, fast, binary format.
    - **REST**: Uses **JSON** or **XML**, which is easy for humans to read but larger and slower to transmit.
2. **Communication**
    - **gRPC**: Uses **HTTP/2** for communication, allowing advanced features like:
        - Sending multiple requests at the same time.
        - Sending data in both directions (streaming).
    - **REST**: Uses **HTTP/1.1** or sometimes HTTP/2 but doesn’t have built-in streaming. For similar features, REST uses workarounds like WebSockets or long polling.
3. **Performance**
    - **gRPC**: Faster due to binary data (smaller size) and efficient HTTP/2 features.
    - **REST**: Slower because of text-based data (like JSON) and HTTP/1.1 limitations.
4. **Contracts (How APIs are Defined)**
    - **gRPC**: Services are defined in a `.proto` file. This ensures **strong typing** and generates client and server code automatically, reducing mistakes.
    - **REST**: Can use tools like OpenAPI to define APIs but often requires more manual effort.
5. **Ecosystem and Support**
    - **gRPC**: Newer but supports many languages and platforms. Popular for **microservices** and cloud systems.
    - **REST**: Older and widely used with rich tools and libraries.

### Example Comparison: Banking Application

#### gRPC Service Definition

```proto
service BankingService {
    rpc GetAccountDetails(AccountRequest) returns (AccountResponse) {}
}

message AccountRequest {
    string account_number = 1;  // Request contains the account number.
}

message AccountResponse {
    string account_name = 1;   // Response contains account name.
    int32 balance = 2;         // Response contains account balance.
}
```

- A **client** sends a request with the `account_number`.
- The **server** responds with `account_name` and `balance`.

#### RESTful API Endpoint

```http
GET /accounts/{account_number}
```

Example Response:

```json
{
    "account_name": "John Doe",
    "balance": 5000
}
```

- The client sends an HTTP GET request with the account number in the URL.
- The server responds with account details in JSON.

### Which One Should You Use?

1. **Choose gRPC If**:
    - You need **high performance** (low latency, small data size).
    - You're building a **microservices system** or need **streaming** communication.
2. **Choose REST If**:
    - You want simplicity and **human-readable data**.
    - You’re integrating with older systems or using standard web browsers.

### Summary

- gRPC: Faster, binary data, streaming support, great for modern services.
- REST: Simpler, human-readable, great for older systems or simpler APIs.
