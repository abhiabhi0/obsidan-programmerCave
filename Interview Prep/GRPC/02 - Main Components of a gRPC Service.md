1. **Protocol Buffers (ProtoBuf)**
    
    - Think of ProtoBuf as a recipe book for your gRPC service.
    - It describes:
        - **Service methods**: What the server can do for the client.
        - **Message types**: The format of the data sent between the client and server.
    - Example:
        
        ```proto
        syntax = "proto3";
        
        service MyService {
            rpc GetData(DataRequest) returns (DataResponse) {}
        }
        
        message DataRequest {
            string query = 1;  // Input from the client
        }
        
        message DataResponse {
            string result = 1; // Output from the server
        }
        ```
        
2. **gRPC Server**
    
    - The server is like a chef who follows the recipe (ProtoBuf file).
    - It implements the **logic** behind the service methods (e.g., what happens when the client calls `GetData`).
3. **gRPC Client**
    
    - The client is like a diner who orders food from the chef.
    - It uses a **stub** (a pre-made helper code generated from the ProtoBuf file) to communicate with the server.
4. **Services**
    
    - Services are like menus in a restaurant.
    - They list the available "dishes" (methods) the server can serve to the client. In the example above, `GetData` is the only method.
5. **Message Types**
    
    - These are like the ingredients (data) exchanged between the client and server.
    - For instance:
        - The client sends a `DataRequest` (with the ingredient `query`).
        - The server replies with a `DataResponse` (with the ingredient `result`).
