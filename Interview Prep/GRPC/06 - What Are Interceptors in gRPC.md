Interceptors are like **middleware** in gRPC. They sit between the client and server communication, allowing you to:

- Inspect requests and responses.
- Modify or add extra processing.
- Handle cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, or rate limiting.

They act like "hooks" to inject logic at different stages of the request-response lifecycle.

### **Types of Interceptors**

gRPC supports two types of interceptors:

1. **Server Interceptors**: Work on the server side, processing requests from clients or responses to clients.
2. **Client Interceptors**: Work on the client side, processing outgoing requests or incoming responses.

---

### **What Can Interceptors Be Used For?**

Interceptors are useful for implementing common functionalities across many services:

- **Logging:** Record details about requests and responses for debugging or monitoring.
- **Authentication:** Verify that the client or user has permission to access a resource.
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevent clients from sending too many requests in a short time.
- **Error Handling:** Transform raw errors into user-friendly messages.
- **Metrics Collection:** Measure response times, request counts, etc.

---

### **How Interceptors Work**

- **Server Side**:  
    A server interceptor intercepts requests as they arrive, performs actions (e.g., logging or validating credentials), and then forwards the request to the actual handler.
- **Client Side**:  
    A client interceptor intercepts requests before they are sent and responses as they are received. It can modify the request (e.g., add a header) or log the response.

### **Server Interceptor Example (Python)**

Here’s a Python example of a server interceptor that logs requests and responses:

```python
import grpc

def logging_server_interceptor(continuation, handler_call_details):
    # Pre-processing: Log incoming request details
    print(f"Incoming request: {handler_call_details.method}")

    # Call the actual handler (or the next interceptor in the chain)
    response = continuation(handler_call_details)

    # Post-processing: Log after handling the request
    print("Response sent to client")
    return response

# Add the interceptor to the server
server = grpc.server(futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10))
interceptors = [grpc.unary_unary_rpc_method_handler(logging_server_interceptor)]
server.add_generic_rpc_handlers(interceptors)
```

---

### **Client Interceptor Example (Python)**

Here’s a Python example of a client interceptor that adds an authentication token to every request:

```python
import grpc

class AuthClientInterceptor(grpc.UnaryUnaryClientInterceptor):
    def __init__(self, token):
        self.token = token

    def intercept_unary_unary(self, continuation, client_call_details, request):
        # Add an authentication header to the outgoing request
        metadata = client_call_details.metadata or []
        metadata.append(("authorization", f"Bearer {self.token}"))
        new_call_details = client_call_details._replace(metadata=metadata)

        # Call the next interceptor or send the request
        return continuation(new_call_details, request)

# Add the interceptor to the client
interceptor = AuthClientInterceptor(token="my-secret-token")
channel = grpc.insecure_channel("localhost:50051")
intercepted_channel = grpc.intercept_channel(channel, interceptor)
```

---

### **How Interceptors Are Structured**

1. **Pre-processing**: What happens before the request or response is handled (e.g., add a header or log details).
2. **Call Handling**: Forward the request or response to the next step in the chain.
3. **Post-processing**: What happens after the request or response has been handled (e.g., log a response or modify it).

---

### **Use Cases of Interceptors**

|**Use Case**|**Example**|
|---|---|
|**Logging**|Log all incoming and outgoing requests.|
|**Authentication**|Check if a user is authorized to access a service.|
|**Rate Limiting**|Restrict clients from sending too many requests.|
|**Error Transformation**|Transform raw server errors into user-friendly ones.|
|**Metrics Collection**|Measure request counts or response times.|

---

### **Key Benefits**

- **Centralized Logic**: Write once and apply to all RPCs.
- **Reusable Code**: Avoid duplicating code for cross-cutting concerns.
- **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to manage common logic across services.
