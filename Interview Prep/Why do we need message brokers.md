● Decoupling: Message brokers promote independent development, deployment, and scaling by creating a separation between software components. The result is easier maintenance and troubleshooting.

● Asynchronous communication: A message broker allows components to communicate without waiting for responses, making the system more efficient and enabling effective load balancing.

● Message brokers ensure that messages are not lost during component failures by providing buffering and message persistence.

● Scalability: Message brokers can manage a high volume of messages, allowing your system to scale horizontally by adding more instances of the message broker as needed.
