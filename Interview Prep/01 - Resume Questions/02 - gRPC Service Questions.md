**1. Why did you choose gRPC for handling user offer data?**

- **Answer:**
    - gRPC provides high-performance communication with low latency due to its binary serialization format (Protocol Buffers).
    - It supports bidirectional streaming, which is useful for real-time data updates.
    - Strongly-typed contracts in `.proto` files make APIs easy to maintain and less error-prone.

---

**2. Can you explain the structure of the gRPC service you developed?**
- I worked on Bulk subscription migration, migrating multiple users from current offer to target offer
- Upload csv file with user ids and their current offer and another value with target offer.
---

**3. How did you handle authentication and security in the gRPC service?**

- **Answer:**
    - Added token-based authentication using metadata in gRPC requests (e.g., JWT). [[JSON Web Token (JWT)]]
    - Ensured role-based access control to prevent unauthorized operations.

---

**4. What challenges did you face while implementing the gRPC service?**

- **Answer:**
    - Managing schema evolution in `.proto` files to ensure backward compatibility.
    - Debugging issues with serialization due to incorrect field definitions.
    - Handling retries and timeouts for network failures gracefully.

---

**5. How did you ensure reliability and scalability of the gRPC service?**

- **Answer:**
    - Deployed the service with Kubernetes, using horizontal pod autoscaling based on CPU/memory usage.
    - Added retries with exponential backoff for transient failures.
    - Used load balancing to distribute traffic evenly across service instances.

#### **Kafka Producer Questions**

**6. Why did you choose Kafka for message processing?**

- **Answer:**
    - Kafka provides high throughput, low latency, and durability, making it ideal for real-time message streaming.
    - It supports partitioning for horizontal scalability, ensuring messages can be processed in parallel.

---

**7. How did the gRPC service produce messages to Kafka?**

- **Answer:**
    - After processing a user offer request, the service serialized the data into JSON or Avro format.
    - Used a Kafka producer library to send the message to a specific topic (e.g., `user-offers`).
    - Example code snippet:
        
        ```go
        producer.Produce(&kafka.Message{
          TopicPartition: kafka.TopicPartition{Topic: &"user-offers", Partition: kafka.PartitionAny},
          Value:          []byte(serializedMessage),
        }, nil)
        ```
        

---

**8. How did you ensure message delivery guarantees while producing to Kafka?**

- **Answer:**
    - Configured the producer with `acks=all` to ensure messages were acknowledged by all Kafka replicas.
    - Used retries with backoff to handle temporary failures.
    - Monitored the producer for errors and implemented fallback mechanisms for undeliverable messages.

---

#### **Kafka Consumer Questions**

**9. How did you implement the Kafka consumer?**

- **Answer:**
    - Used a Kafka consumer library (e.g., Confluent’s Kafka library for Go) to subscribe to the `user-offers` topic.
    - Polled messages in a loop, deserialized the payload, and updated user offer codes in the database.
    - Example code snippet:
        
        ```go
        consumer.SubscribeTopics([]string{"user-offers"}, nil)
        for {
          msg, err := consumer.ReadMessage(-1)
          if err == nil {
            processMessage(msg)
          } else {
            log.Printf("Consumer error: %v", err)
          }
        }
        ```
        

---

**10. How did you ensure the consumer handled failures gracefully?**

- **Answer:**
    - Implemented error handling for message deserialization issues.
    - Used dead-letter queues (DLQs) to store messages that couldn’t be processed.
    - Added retries for transient failures like database connectivity issues.

---

**11. How did you ensure exactly-once or at-least-once message processing?**

- **Answer:**
    - Used Kafka’s offset management to commit offsets only after successful processing.
    - Ensured idempotency in the consumer logic (e.g., updating user offer codes in a way that multiple updates with the same data wouldn’t cause inconsistencies).

---

#### **Integration Questions**

**12. How did the gRPC service and Kafka integration work together?**

- **Answer:**
    - The gRPC service acted as a producer, sending user offer data as messages to Kafka.
    - The Kafka consumer subscribed to the topic and processed these messages to update user offer codes dynamically.

---

**13. How did you ensure data consistency between the gRPC service, Kafka, and the database?**

- **Answer:**
    - Used transactional producers to ensure messages were published atomically with database updates.
    - Designed the consumer to handle duplicate messages idempotently, ensuring no data corruption.
    - Monitored lag to ensure timely processing of Kafka messages.

---

**14. How did you monitor the entire pipeline (gRPC service, Kafka producer, and consumer)?**

- **Answer:**
    - Added metrics using Prometheus to track producer and consumer performance (e.g., message rates, errors, latencies).
    - Used Datadog dashboards to monitor Kafka topics, consumer lag, and system health.
    - Configured alerts for anomalies like high message lag or failed retries.
