**6. Why did you choose Kafka for message processing?**

- **Answer:**
    - Kafka provides high throughput, low latency, and durability, making it ideal for real-time message streaming.
    - It supports partitioning for horizontal scalability, ensuring messages can be processed in parallel.

**7. How did the gRPC service produce messages to Kafka?**

- **Answer:**
    - After processing a user offer request, the service serialized the data into JSON or Avro format.
    - Used a Kafka producer library to send the message to a specific topic (e.g., `user-offers`).
    - Example code snippet:
        
        ```go
        producer.Produce(&kafka.Message{
          TopicPartition: kafka.TopicPartition{Topic: &"user-offers", Partition: kafka.PartitionAny},
          Value:          []byte(serializedMessage),
        }, nil)
        ```

**8. How did you ensure message delivery guarantees while producing to Kafka?**

- **Answer:**
    - Configured the producer with `acks=all` to ensure messages were acknowledged by all Kafka replicas.
    - Used retries with backoff to handle temporary failures.
    - Monitored the producer for errors and implemented fallback mechanisms for undeliverable messages.

**9. How did you implement the Kafka consumer?**

- **Answer:**
    - Used a Kafka consumer library (e.g., Confluent’s Kafka library for Go) to subscribe to the `user-offers` topic.
    - Polled messages in a loop, deserialized the payload, and updated user offer codes in the database.
    - Example code snippet:
        
        ```go
        consumer.SubscribeTopics([]string{"user-offers"}, nil)
        for {
          msg, err := consumer.ReadMessage(-1)
          if err == nil {
            processMessage(msg)
          } else {
            log.Printf("Consumer error: %v", err)
          }
        }
        ```

**10. How did you ensure the consumer handled failures gracefully?**

- **Answer:**
    - Implemented error handling for message deserialization issues.
    - Used dead-letter queues (DLQs) to store messages that couldn’t be processed.
    - Added retries for transient failures like database connectivity issues.

**11. How did you ensure exactly-once or at-least-once message processing?**

- **Answer:**
    - Used Kafka’s offset management to commit offsets only after successful processing.
    - Ensured idempotency in the consumer logic (e.g., updating user offer codes in a way that multiple updates with the same data wouldn’t cause inconsistencies).
