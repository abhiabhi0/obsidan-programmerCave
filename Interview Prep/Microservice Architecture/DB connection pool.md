A database connection pool is a cache of database connections maintained so that the connections can be reused when needed. It is a common optimization technique used in applications that interact with databases to improve performance and manage resource utilization. Instead of opening and closing a new database connection for every database operation, a connection pool keeps a set of connections open and ready for use.

Hereâ€™s how a database connection pool works:

- **Initialization**: When an application starts, a fixed number of database connections are created and added to the pool.
- **Connection Request**: When an application needs to perform a database operation, it requests a connection from the pool.
- **Usage**: The application uses the borrowed connection to perform the database operation.
- **Return**: After the operation is complete, the connection is returned to the pool instead of being closed. It is marked as available for reuse.
- **Reuse**: The next time the application needs a database connection, it can request one from the pool. If a connection is available, it is reused; otherwise, the application waits until a connection becomes available.

**Improved Performance**: Connection pooling reduces the overhead associated with opening and closing database connections for every database operation.

**Resource Efficiency**: Database connections can be a limited and valuable resource. Connection pooling ensures that connections are used efficiently by minimizing the number of idle and unused connections.
