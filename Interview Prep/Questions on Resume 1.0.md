**Can you elaborate on how you structured the microservice for attributing cloud and external services cost to tenants in Golang?**
- In this services we were calculating infra structure cost, external services cost and attributing this cost to tenants.
- Infrastructure cost is the cost of namespaces and this we were getting from Cast.AI. [[CAST AI]] agent was deployed in each cluster and using this cast AI calculates the cost of each namespace daily.
- Each tenant may has one or more products deployed. For some products we used call duration to distributed the namespace cost if the same namespace and services inside it is used by many tenants.
- For some products we have separate namespace for each tenant.
- Then using this infra cost of each tenant we distribute external services cost to each tenant.
- We were also fetching tenant login details using Auth0 and storing in our DB.
- Using Kube APIs we were getting pod metrics periodically and storing in DB.
- From Kong we were getting network metrics of microservices periodically and storing in DB.
- Getting AWS services cost and Datadog cost daily and storing in DB.
- Getting tenant call details for products using Kafka Consumer.

### Can you explain the specific Kubernetes APIs you utilized and how they were used in your project?
We wanted the cpu request and usage and memory request and usage for each pod. And pod belongs to a replicaSet or a statefulSet and a replicaSet belongs to deployment. So there are two apis provided by kubernetes which gives request and usage metrics of each pod.

### How did you integrate Kong with your application, and what specific functionalities did you leverage?
Kong is an API gateway. We installed kong in our kubernetes cluster. So every api calls made to any service running in this cluster will go through kong. So kong stores are the network related information like total http requests, error requests etc. Kong provides access to this information using port 8000 to api is the ip address of pod. In each service we can add kong plugings.

### What AWS services did you interact with using the AWS SDK, and what were the primary operations you performed?
I interacted with S3, Secret Manager, Cost Explorer, RDS. Used Cost Explorer APIs to get daily cost of each AWS Services.

### Could you describe how you used Datadog APIs in your project and what metrics or data you were monitoring?
Used DD APIs to get daily estimated cost.

### What role did Cast.AI play in your project, and how did it help with your data retrieval process?
As part of cost reduction, we install cast ai agent in our cluster. Using its APIs we get daily namespaces cost

### Why did you choose Golang for this implementation, and what benefits did it offer for your use case?
I chose Golang for this implementation due to its strong performance and efficiency, which are crucial for handling high-frequency data retrieval and processing. Golang’s concurrency model, based on goroutines, allowed us to easily manage multiple data retrieval tasks simultaneously without significant overhead. Additionally, Golang's robust standard library provided excellent support for HTTP and networking operations, which simplified the integration with Kubernetes APIs, Kong, AWS SDK, Datadog APIs, and Cast.AI.

The language’s simplicity and readability also facilitated quicker development and easier maintenance of the codebase.

### Can you walk me through the process of retrieving data at intervals and how you ensured the accuracy and reliability of this data?
So for different type of data we had different tables in DB. So retrieval is independent from other. We were running cron jobs to get data at regular interval. For reliablity and accuracy we have unique constraint in our tables and then error handling and proper logging and also alerts.

### How did you structure and manage the data stored in PostgreSQL?
carefully designed the database schema to reflect the data relationships and requirements. implemented indexes on frequently queried columns to speed up search operations and improve query performance. Created monthly and weekly tables to decrease API response time.

### Can you explain the architecture of your Kafka setup and where the consumer fits within it?
1. **Producers**: These are applications or services that publish (send) messages to Kafka topics.
2. **Kafka Cluster**: This is the core of the setup, consisting of multiple Kafka brokers. The brokers handle the storage, replication, and distribution of messages. Topics in Kafka are divided into partitions, and each partition can be replicated across multiple brokers to ensure fault tolerance.
3. **Topics and Partitions**: Kafka organizes messages into topics, which are further divided into partitions. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of messages that can be read independently by consumers.
4. **Consumers**: These are applications or services that read (consume) messages from Kafka topics. Consumers can be part of a consumer group, where each consumer in the group reads from different partitions of a topic to balance the load.

### How did you handle the deserialization of messages in Golang?
Used kafka library available to deserailize data into json format.

### Developed **WebSocket** server for receiving the media from client side with **Spring Boot** Stomp message handling.
```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class WebSocketServerApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(WebSocketServerApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Configuration
    @EnableWebSocketMessageBroker
    public static class WebSocketConfig implements WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer {

        @Override
        public void configureMessageBroker(MessageBrokerRegistry config) {
            config.enableSimpleBroker("/topic");
            config.setApplicationDestinationPrefixes("/app");
        }

        @Override
        public void registerStompEndpoints(StompEndpointRegistry registry) {
            registry.addEndpoint("/websocket").withSockJS();
        }
    }

    @RestController
    public static class MediaController {

        @MessageMapping("/media")
        @SendTo("/topic/media")
        public String handleMedia(@Payload String media) {
            // Process the received media here
            return "Media received: " + media;
        }
    }
}
```

- We configure WebSocket support using `@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker` annotation in the `WebSocketConfig` class.
-  We define message broker configurations in the `configureMessageBroker` method.
    - `config.enableSimpleBroker("/topic")`: This enables a simple in-memory message broker. This broker will carry messages back to clients on destinations prefixed with "/topic". It essentially acts as a message relay, forwarding messages sent to it.
    - `config.setApplicationDestinationPrefixes("/app")`: This sets the prefix for messages that are bound for `@MessageMapping` methods. When a client sends a message to a destination that starts with "/app", it will be routed to a `@MessageMapping` method.
- We define the endpoint for the WebSocket connection and enable SockJS fallback in the `registerStompEndpoints` method.
- We have a `MediaController` class with a method annotated with `@MessageMapping("/media")` which listens for messages sent to the "/media" destination.
- This setup allows clients to connect to the WebSocket server, send messages to the "/app" prefixed destinations, and receive messages broadcasted to "/topic" prefixed destinations.

### How would you handle authentication and authorization for WebSocket connections in this setup?
 - **Securing the WebSocket Endpoint** - configuring Spring Security to protect the WebSocket endpoint
```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/websocket/**").authenticated() // Secure the WebSocket endpoint
            .anyRequest().permitAll()
            .and()
            .csrf().disable() // Disable CSRF protection for simplicity, but consider your security needs
            .formLogin();
    }
}
```
 
- **Adding Authentication Interceptor** - create a `ChannelInterceptor` to intercept and authenticate WebSocket connections.
```java
@Component
public class WebSocketAuthInterceptor implements ChannelInterceptor {

    @Override
    public Message<?> preSend(Message<?> message, MessageChannel channel) {
        StompHeaderAccessor accessor = MessageHeaderAccessor.getAccessor(message, StompHeaderAccessor.class);

        if (StompHeaderAccessor.CONNECT.equals(accessor.getCommand())) {
            String username = accessor.getFirstNativeHeader("username");
            String authToken = accessor.getFirstNativeHeader("authToken");

            // Implement your authentication logic here
            if (isValidToken(username, authToken)) {
                Authentication authentication = getAuthentication(username);
                SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authentication);
                accessor.setUser(authentication);
            } else {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid credentials");
            }
        }

        return message;
    }

    private boolean isValidToken(String username, String authToken) {
        // Validate the token (e.g., check in the database or a token service)
        return true; // Replace with actual validation logic
    }

    private Authentication getAuthentication(String username) {
        // Fetch the user details and create an Authentication object
        UserDetails userDetails = loadUserByUsername(username);
        return new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(userDetails, null, userDetails.getAuthorities());
    }

    private UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String username) {
        // Load the user from your user service or database
        return new User(username, "", new ArrayList<>()); // Replace with actual user details
    }
}
```
 - **Registering the Interceptor**
```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker
public class WebSocketConfig implements WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer {

    private final WebSocketAuthInterceptor webSocketAuthInterceptor;

    public WebSocketConfig(WebSocketAuthInterceptor webSocketAuthInterceptor) {
        this.webSocketAuthInterceptor = webSocketAuthInterceptor;
    }

    @Override
    public void registerStompEndpoints(StompEndpointRegistry registry) {
        registry.addEndpoint("/websocket").withSockJS();
    }

    @Override
    public void configureClientInboundChannel(ChannelRegistration registration) {
        registration.interceptors(webSocketAuthInterceptor);
    }
}
```

- **Client-Side Authentication**
```javascript
var socket = new SockJS('http://localhost:8080/websocket');
var stompClient = Stomp.over(socket);

stompClient.connect({'username': 'user', 'authToken': 'token'}, function (frame) {
    console.log('Connected: ' + frame);
    stompClient.subscribe('/topic/media', function (message) {
        console.log(message.body);
    });
    stompClient.send("/app/media", {}, "Test media data");
});
```

### Implemented WebSocket client using Javax for streaming the media data to ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) engine.
```java
@ClientEndpoint
public class WebSocketClient {

    private Session session;

    public WebSocketClient(URI endpointURI) {
        try {
            WebSocketContainer container = ContainerProvider.getWebSocketContainer();
            container.connectToServer(this, endpointURI);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    @OnMessage
    public void onMessage(String message) {
        // Handle response from ASR engine
        System.out.println("Received response: " + message);
    }

    public void sendMessage(String message) {
        if (session != null && session.isOpen()) {
            session.getAsyncRemote().sendText(message);
        }
    }

    public void sendMediaData(byte[] data) {
        if (session != null && session.isOpen()) {
            session.getAsyncRemote().sendBinary(ByteBuffer.wrap(data));
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        URI uri = URI.create("ws://asr-engine-endpoint/websocket");
        WebSocketClient client = new WebSocketClient(uri);

        // Example usage: sending a text message
        client.sendMessage("Hello ASR Engine!");

        // Example usage: sending binary media data
        byte[] mediaData = ... // Your media data here
        client.sendMediaData(mediaData);
    }
}
```

- We define a `WebSocketClient` class annotated with `@ClientEndpoint`, indicating it is a WebSocket client endpoint.
- The constructor of `WebSocketClient` connects to the WebSocket server at the provided URI.
- The `onMessage` method handles messages received from the WebSocket server.
- The `sendMessage` method sends text messages to the server.
- The `sendMediaData` method sends binary media data to the server.
- In the `main` method, we create an instance of `WebSocketClient` and demonstrate sending a text message and binary media data.

### Developed **GORM** (ORM library for **Golang**) based **RESTFUL APIs** with token-based access control

```go
// User represents a user model
type User struct {
	gorm.Model
	Username string `json:"username"`
	Password string `json:"password"`
}

// Post represents a post model
type Post struct {
	gorm.Model
	Title   string `json:"title"`
	Content string `json:"content"`
	UserID  uint   `json:"user_id"`
}

// Token is a simple struct to hold a JWT token
type Token struct {
	Token string `json:"token"`
}

var db *gorm.DB

func initDB() {
	var err error
	db, err = gorm.Open("sqlite3", "test.db")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Failed to connect to database:", err)
	}
	db.AutoMigrate(&User{}, &Post{})
}

func createToken(username string) (string, error) {
	// Create token
	token := jwt.NewWithClaims(jwt.SigningMethodHS256, jwt.MapClaims{
		"username": username,
	})
	// Sign token
	tokenString, err := token.SignedString([]byte("secret"))
	if err != nil {
		return "", err
	}
	return tokenString, nil
}

func authenticate(next http.HandlerFunc) http.HandlerFunc {
	return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		tokenHeader := r.Header.Get("Authorization")
		if tokenHeader == "" {
			http.Error(w, "Missing token", http.StatusForbidden)
			return
		}
		tokenStr := strings.Split(tokenHeader, " ")[1]
		token, err := jwt.Parse(tokenStr, func(token *jwt.Token) (interface{}, error) {
			return []byte("secret"), nil
		})
		if err != nil {
			http.Error(w, "Invalid token", http.StatusForbidden)
			return
		}
		if !token.Valid {
			http.Error(w, "Invalid token", http.StatusForbidden)
			return
		}
		next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
	})
}

func register(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	var user User
	json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&user)
	db.Create(&user)
	token, _ := createToken(user.Username)
	json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(Token{Token: token})
}

func login(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	var user User
	json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&user)
	var dbUser User
	db.Where("username = ?", user.Username).First(&dbUser)
	if dbUser.Password != user.Password {
		http.Error(w, "Invalid credentials", http.StatusUnauthorized)
		return
	}
	token, _ := createToken(user.Username)
	json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(Token{Token: token})
}

func getPosts(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	var posts []Post
	db.Find(&posts)

	// Pagination
	page, _ := strconv.Atoi(r.URL.Query().Get("page"))
	if page < 1 {
		page = 1
	}
	limit, _ := strconv.Atoi(r.URL.Query().Get("limit"))
	if limit < 1 {
		limit = 10
	}
	offset := (page - 1) * limit

	// Sorting
	sort := r.URL.Query().Get("sort")
	if sort == "" {
		sort = "created_at desc"
	}

	// Searching and filtering
	query := db.Order(sort).Offset(offset).Limit(limit)
	title := r.URL.Query().Get("title")
	if title != "" {
		query = query.Where("title LIKE ?", "%"+title+"%")
	}

	query.Find(&posts)
	json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(posts)
}

func main() {
	initDB()
	defer db.Close()

	router := mux.NewRouter()

	router.HandleFunc("/register", register).Methods("POST")
	router.HandleFunc("/login", login).Methods("POST")
	router.HandleFunc("/posts", authenticate(getPosts)).Methods("GET")

	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", router))
}
```

- **Models**: `User` and `Post` structs are defined to represent database models.
- **Database Initialization**: `initDB` initializes the SQLite database and automigrates the models.
- **Token Creation**: `createToken` generates JWT tokens.
- **Authentication Middleware**: `authenticate` middleware verifies the JWT token from the request headers.

### Can you explain the purpose of the `gorm.Model` embedded struct in the `User` and `Post` models?
The `gorm.Model` embedded struct in the `User` and `Post` models serves the purpose of providing common fields and functionalities that are often needed in database models.

### Which specific Kong Plugins did you implement to secure access to APIs, and why did you choose those particular plugins?
- **JWT Authentication Plugin**: This plugin enables authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), providing a stateless mechanism for securing API endpoints. It's suitable for securing microservices architectures and mobile applications.

### Can you explain the process of integrating Kong with your APIs and configuring the necessary plugins?
1. **Install and Configure Kong Gateway**: Start by installing Kong Gateway on your infrastructure. This could be done using package managers, Docker containers, or by building from source. Once installed, configure Kong by specifying the necessary settings such as database connection details, admin API listening address, etc.
    
2. **Define Services and Routes**: In Kong, a Service represents an upstream API or microservice, and a Route defines how requests to that service should be routed. You'll need to define one or more Services and associate them with Routes. These routes specify the URL paths and methods that Kong should proxy to your APIs.
    
3. **Add Plugins**: Depending on your security and functionality requirements, you'll need to add appropriate plugins to your services and routes. For example:
    
    - **Authentication Plugins**: If you need to secure your APIs with authentication mechanisms like JWT, OAuth, or basic authentication, you'll add corresponding authentication plugins like `kong-plugin-jwt`, `kong-plugin-oauth2`, or `kong-plugin-basic-auth`.
    - **Rate Limiting Plugins**: To protect your APIs from abuse or overuse, you might add rate limiting plugins like `kong-plugin-rate-limiting` to throttle incoming requests.
    - **Security Plugins**: If you want to enhance the security of your APIs by adding features like CORS protection, request/response validation, or encryption, you'll add relevant security plugins such as `kong-plugin-cors`, `kong-plugin-request-transformer`, or `kong-plugin-response-transformer`.
4. **Configure Plugin Parameters**: Once you've added plugins to your services and routes, you'll need to configure their parameters according to your specific requirements. For example, if you're using a rate limiting plugin, you'll set the maximum number of requests allowed per minute. Similarly, for authentication plugins, you'll configure JWT secret keys or OAuth client IDs and secrets.
    
5. **Test and Deploy**: Before deploying Kong Gateway into production, it's crucial to thoroughly test the configured plugins and ensure they behave as expected. Test various scenarios including valid and invalid requests, different authentication methods, and rate limiting thresholds. Once testing is complete, deploy Kong Gateway into your production environment.
    
6. **Monitor and Maintain**: After deployment, continuously monitor the performance and health of Kong Gateway and the configured plugins. Monitor metrics like request latency, error rates, and throughput to identify any issues or bottlenecks. Regularly update Kong Gateway and plugins to ensure you're benefiting from the latest features and security patches.

### Can you describe the role of Kong in your API infrastructure and how it fits into the overall architecture?
Kong serves as the API gateway in our infrastructure, acting as the entry point for all incoming API requests. Its primary role is to manage, secure, and orchestrate traffic between clients and our backend services. In our overall architecture, Kong plays a pivotal role by providing a centralized platform for implementing various security, authentication, rate limiting, and traffic management policies across all our APIs.

### Progressive deployment and monitoring production services using **Flux CD**.
Flux CD is a tool used for progressive deployment and monitoring of production services, particularly in the context of Kubernetes environments. It automates the deployment process by continuously monitoring and synchronizing changes from a version control system, such as Git, to a Kubernetes cluster. Flux CD enables organizations to implement GitOps practices, where the entire configuration and deployment process is managed through Git repositories.

Here's a brief overview of how Flux CD works:

1. **Continuous Deployment**: Flux CD continuously monitors a Git repository containing Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts. Whenever changes are pushed to the repository, Flux CD detects them and automatically applies the changes to the Kubernetes cluster.
    
2. **GitOps Workflow**: With Flux CD, the entire configuration of the Kubernetes cluster, including application deployments, configurations, and infrastructure definitions, is stored in Git repositories. This ensures that the desired state of the cluster is always represented in Git, providing a single source of truth for the entire deployment process.
    
3. **Automated Rollouts**: Flux CD supports automated rollouts of new versions of applications by gradually updating the deployment configurations in the Kubernetes cluster. It can manage canary deployments, blue-green deployments, and other progressive deployment strategies to minimize the risk of introducing errors or disruptions.
    
4. **Integration with Monitoring Tools**: Flux CD can integrate with various monitoring and observability tools to provide insights into the health and performance of deployed applications. By leveraging metrics and alerts from monitoring systems, Flux CD can automate rollback procedures in case of failures or degraded performance.
    
5. **Declarative Configuration**: Flux CD uses a declarative approach to define the desired state of the Kubernetes cluster. Operators specify the desired configuration of applications, environments, and services in Git repositories using YAML manifests or Helm charts. Flux CD ensures that the actual state of the cluster matches the declared state.
    
6. **Versioning and Rollback**: Flux CD maintains a version history of deployed applications and configurations, allowing operators to easily rollback to previous versions in case of issues or regressions. This versioning capability provides a safety net for deploying changes to production environments.

### Can you describe a scenario where Flux CD's progressive deployment capabilities would be particularly beneficial for a production service?
With Flux CD, you can implement canary deployments, where new versions of the application are initially deployed to a small subset of servers or pods, allowing you to monitor their performance and stability before rolling out the update to the entire production environment. This approach helps mitigate the risk of introducing bugs or performance issues that could affect all users.

### What steps would you take to set up Flux CD for a Kubernetes cluster and integrate it with your existing deployment pipelines?
1. **Install Flux CD**: The first step is to install Flux CD onto your Kubernetes cluster. You can do this by applying the Flux manifests provided by the Flux CD project, or by using Helm charts if you prefer Helm. This typically involves creating a Kubernetes namespace for Flux CD and deploying the necessary resources.
    
2. **Configure Git Repository**: Flux CD operates based on the configuration stored in a Git repository. You need to configure Flux CD to watch a specific Git repository where your Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts are stored. This includes providing authentication credentials or SSH keys to access the repository.
    
3. **Define Flux Sync Rules**: Flux CD watches the configured Git repository for changes and automatically applies those changes to the Kubernetes cluster. You need to define sync rules to specify which resources Flux CD should manage. This can include namespaces, deployments, services, and other Kubernetes objects.
    
4. **Configure Automation Policies**: Flux CD supports various automation policies for managing deployments, including automated rollouts, canary deployments, and automated rollbacks. Depending on your requirements, you may need to configure these policies to align with your deployment pipeline.
    
5. **Integrate with CI/CD Pipeline**: To fully integrate Flux CD with your existing deployment pipelines, you need to trigger Flux CD deployments as part of your CI/CD process. This typically involves updating your CI/CD scripts or configurations to trigger Flux CD synchronization after successful builds or releases.
    
6. **Handle Secrets and Sensitive Data**: If your Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts contain secrets or sensitive data, you need to handle these securely. Flux CD provides mechanisms for managing secrets using Kubernetes secrets or external secret management solutions. Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted and properly managed throughout the deployment process.
    
7. **Test and Validate**: Before fully integrating Flux CD into your production environment, it's important to thoroughly test and validate the setup. This includes testing Flux CD synchronization, deployment automation, rollback procedures, and integration with existing pipelines.
    
8. **Monitor and Maintain**: Once Flux CD is integrated and operational, monitor its performance and health regularly. Set up alerts and monitoring to detect any issues or failures in the deployment process. Additionally, keep Flux CD and its dependencies up to date with the latest versions to benefit from bug fixes and new features.

### Can you explain the difference between blue-green deployments and canary deployments, and when each approach might be preferable?

1. **Blue-Green Deployments**:
    - In a blue-green deployment, two identical production environments, typically referred to as "blue" and "green," are maintained.
    - At any given time, only one of these environments, say the "blue" environment, serves live traffic while the "green" environment remains inactive.
    - When a new version of the application is ready for deployment, it is deployed to the inactive "green" environment.
    - After the deployment is completed and the new version is tested and verified in the "green" environment, traffic is gradually switched from the "blue" environment to the "green" environment.
    - Once all traffic has been successfully redirected to the "green" environment, the "blue" environment can be safely decommissioned or retained as a backup.
    
    **Preferable Scenarios for Blue-Green Deployments**:
    - Blue-green deployments are preferable when there is a need for minimal downtime during deployments since traffic is switched seamlessly between environments.
    - They are useful for rolling back deployments quickly in case of issues since the previous version of the application is still running in the "blue" environment.
    - Blue-green deployments are well-suited for applications with strict uptime requirements or those serving high volumes of traffic.
2. **Canary Deployments**:
    - In a canary deployment, a small subset of users or traffic, often referred to as the "canary group," is selected to receive the new version of the application.
    - The new version is initially deployed to the canary group while the rest of the users continue to use the stable version of the application.
    - Monitoring and metrics are used to observe the performance and behavior of the new version in the canary group.
    - If the new version performs satisfactorily without issues or negative impacts on user experience, the deployment can be gradually expanded to include more users or traffic.
    - Conversely, if issues or anomalies are detected, the deployment can be rolled back before affecting a larger portion of users.
    
    **Preferable Scenarios for Canary Deployments**:
    - Canary deployments are preferable when there is uncertainty about the impact of a new version on the overall system or user experience.
    - They are useful for testing new features, changes, or optimizations in a real-world environment with limited risk exposure.
    - Canary deployments can help identify performance bottlenecks, bugs, or compatibility issues early in the deployment process before a full rollout.

### What mechanisms does Flux CD provide for rolling back deployments in case of failures or unexpected behavior?
1. **Git Reversion**: Since Flux CD relies on Git as the single source of truth, one of the primary rollback mechanisms is reverting the changes in the Git repository to a previous known good state. By simply using Git commands to revert to a previous commit that represents a stable state of the deployment configuration, Flux CD will detect the change and automatically apply the rollback to the Kubernetes cluster.
2. **Helm Rollback**: If using Helm with Flux CD, Helm’s built-in rollback functionality can be utilized. Helm maintains a history of releases, and a previous release can be rolled back using the Helm CLI. This approach requires manual intervention to execute the rollback command, but it leverages Helm’s history and rollback capabilities.

### How would you integrate Garden.io into an existing CI/CD pipeline, and what steps are involved?
#### 1. **Install Garden.io CLI**
- Ensure that the Garden.io CLI is installed on the CI/CD server. This can usually be done using a package manager or by downloading the binary from the Garden.io website.
#### 2. **Configure the Garden Project**
- Create a `garden.yml` configuration file in the root of your repository. This file defines your project, including environments, modules, and workflows.
- Example `garden.yml`
```yaml
kind: Project
name: my-garden-project

environments:
  - name: dev
    default: true
    providers:
      - name: kubernetes
        context: minikube

modules:
  - name: my-service
    type: container
    build:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    services:
      - name: my-service
        ports:
          - name: http
            containerPort: 8080
```
#### 3. **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline Configuration**
- Modify your CI/CD pipeline configuration file (e.g., `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `circleci.yml`) to include Garden.io commands.
- Example with GitLab CI
```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

variables:
  GARDEN_ENV: dev

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - garden build

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - garden test

deploy:
