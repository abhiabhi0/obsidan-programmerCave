To store user-uploaded files like images and videos that require high availability, durability, and global accessibility, the best AWS service to use is **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**. Below is a proposed solution design that meets these requirements:

## Solution Design using Amazon S3

### **1. Bucket Configuration**
- **Create an S3 Bucket**: Start by creating a dedicated S3 bucket for storing user-uploaded files. Ensure that the bucket is configured to allow public access only for specific files if necessary.
- **Storage Class Selection**: Choose the appropriate storage class based on access patterns. For frequently accessed files, use **S3 Standard**; for infrequently accessed files, consider **S3 Standard-IA** or **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** to optimize costs over time[1][5].
- **Versioning**: Enable versioning on the bucket to maintain multiple versions of an object. This is crucial for data recovery and accidental deletions[5].

### **2. Security and Access Management**
- **Bucket Policies**: Implement fine-grained bucket policies to control access. For example, restrict write access to the application while allowing read access through pre-signed URLs[3]. This ensures that only authenticated users can upload files.
- **IAM Roles and Policies**: Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create roles with specific permissions for your application, allowing it to interact with the S3 bucket securely.
- **Pre-signed URLs**: Generate pre-signed URLs for users to access specific objects in the bucket temporarily. This allows secure access without making the objects publicly accessible[3].

### **3. Data Management and Optimization**
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Set up lifecycle policies to automatically transition older files to cheaper storage classes like S3 Glacier or delete them after a specified period. This helps in managing costs effectively[1][5].
- **Monitoring and Analytics**: Utilize Amazon S3 Storage Lens to gain insights into usage patterns and optimize storage based on actual needs[1].
  
### **4. Performance Considerations**
- **Multipart Uploads**: For large files, use multipart uploads to improve upload performance and reliability, especially for larger video files[2].
- **Data Transfer Acceleration**: Enable S3 Transfer Acceleration for faster uploads from geographically dispersed locations.

### **5. Backup and Recovery**
- Regularly back up your data using AWS Backup or by replicating data across regions using Cross-Region Replication (CRR) if necessary.

By implementing this design, you ensure that user-uploaded files are stored securely, are highly available, durable, and accessible globally while also being cost-effective.
