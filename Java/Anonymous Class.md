In Java, an anonymous class is a <mark class="hltr-b">local class without a name</mark>. It's typically <mark class="hltr-g">used for creating a one-time use class that extends an existing class or implements an interface</mark>. Anonymous classes are often used when you need to provide a quick implementation of an interface or override a method of a class without explicitly creating a new subclass.

Here's an example of creating an anonymous class:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an instance of an interface using an anonymous class
        Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("This is an anonymous class implementing the Runnable interface.");
            }
        };

        // Using the instance
        Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

In this example:
- We define an anonymous class that implements the `Runnable` interface and overrides its `run()` method.
- We create an instance of this anonymous class and assign it to a variable of type `Runnable`.
- We pass this instance to the `Thread` constructor, and then start the thread.

Anonymous classes can also be used with abstract classes or with classes that have constructors:

```java
public abstract class AbstractClass {
    public abstract void abstractMethod();
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an instance of an abstract class using an anonymous class
        AbstractClass instance = new AbstractClass() {
            @Override
            public void abstractMethod() {
                System.out.println("This is an anonymous class extending an abstract class.");
            }
        };

        // Using the instance
        instance.abstractMethod();
    }
}
```

In summary, anonymous classes are a concise way to create instances of classes that are needed only once, especially when you need to provide a quick implementation of an interface or override a method without creating a separate named class. However, they should be used judiciously and for simple cases to keep the code readable and maintainable.
