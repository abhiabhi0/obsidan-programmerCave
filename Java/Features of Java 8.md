Java 8 introduced several significant features and enhancements to the Java programming language. Here are some of the key features of Java 8:

### 1. Lambda Expressions
- Lambda expressions introduce a concise syntax for defining anonymous functions.
- They facilitate functional programming by treating functions as first-class citizens.
- Lambda expressions can be used to implement functional interfaces (interfaces with a single abstract method), allowing for more concise code.

### 2. Stream API
- The Stream API provides a fluent, declarative way to process collections of data.
- Streams enable functional-style operations such as filter, map, reduce, and forEach, which can be chained together to form complex data processing pipelines.
- Streams leverage lazy evaluation, potentially improving performance by avoiding unnecessary intermediate computations.

### 3. Functional Interfaces
- Functional interfaces are interfaces that contain exactly one abstract method.
- Java 8 introduced the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation to denote such interfaces.
- Functional interfaces are crucial for working with lambda expressions and the Stream API.

### 4. Default Methods
- Default methods allow interfaces to provide default implementations for methods.
- They enable backward compatibility by allowing interfaces to evolve without breaking existing implementations.
- Default methods are also known as defender methods or virtual extension methods.

### 5. Method References
- Method references provide a shorthand syntax for referring to methods or constructors.
- They can be used as lambda expressions to improve code readability.
- Method references are categorized into four types: static method references, instance method references, constructor references, and array constructor references.

### 6. Optional
- Optional is a container object that may or may not contain a non-null value.
- It helps prevent NullPointerExceptions by providing a more explicit way to handle potentially absent values.
- Optional encourages developers to write cleaner, more robust code by forcing them to consider and handle the absence of a value explicitly.

### 7. Date and Time API (java.time)
- Java 8 introduced a new Date and Time API in the `java.time` package.
- The new API provides classes such as LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, ZonedDateTime, and Duration for working with dates, times, and durations.
- It addresses many shortcomings of the legacy Date and Calendar classes and provides a more intuitive and thread-safe API for date and time manipulation.

### 8. Parallel Array Sorting
- The Arrays class in Java 8 introduced parallel sorting methods (`parallelSort`) for sorting arrays in parallel.
- Parallel sorting can improve the performance of sorting large arrays on multi-core processors by leveraging multiple threads for sorting.

### 9. CompletableFuture
- CompletableFuture is a class that represents a future result of an asynchronous computation.
- It provides a more flexible and composable alternative to the traditional Future interface.
- CompletableFuture supports chaining asynchronous tasks, combining multiple asynchronous computations, and handling exceptional cases more easily.

These features collectively make Java 8 a significant milestone in the evolution of the Java programming language, enabling developers to write more expressive, concise, and efficient code.
