An **anonymous class** is a local class without a name and is used to instantiate classes or interfaces. It allows you to make your code more concise by defining a class that will be used only once. Anonymous classes are particularly useful in scenarios where you want to override methods of a class or implement an interface without creating a separate named class.

#### Key Features of Anonymous Classes
1. **No Name**: As the name suggests, anonymous classes do not have a name.
2. **Single Instantiation**: They can be instantiated only once.
3. **Defined Inside a Method**: Typically declared inside a method or a code block.
4. **No Constructor**: Since they have no name, they cannot have constructors.
5. **Access to Outer Class Members**: They can access the members (including private members) of the enclosing class.
6. **Cannot be Static**: Anonymous classes cannot be static.

#### Syntax
The syntax for creating an anonymous class is similar to that of creating an instance of a class, but it includes the definition of the class body in curly braces:

```java
new SuperclassOrInterface() {
    // Fields, methods, and constructors go here
};
```

### Example of Anonymous Class

#### 1. Implementing an Interface

Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating how to create an anonymous class that implements an interface:

```java
interface Greeting {
    void greet();
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an anonymous class implementing Greeting interface
        Greeting greeting = new Greeting() {
            public void greet() {
                System.out.println("Hello from the anonymous class!");
            }
        };
        greeting.greet(); // Output: Hello from the anonymous class!
    }
}
```

#### 2. Extending a Class

You can also create an anonymous class that extends another class:

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes sound");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an anonymous class extending Animal
        Animal animal = new Animal() {
            void sound() {
                System.out.println("Dog barks");
            }
        };
        animal.sound(); // Output: Dog barks
    }
}
```

### Diagrammatic Representation

Here's a simple diagram illustrating the concept of an anonymous class:

```
+---------------------+
|     Outer Class     |
|                     |
|  +---------------+  |
|  |   Anonymous   |  |
|  |     Class     |  |
|  +---------------+  |
|                     |
+---------------------+
```

In this diagram, the outer class contains the definition of the anonymous class, which is created without a name.

### Differences Between Regular and Anonymous Inner Classes

| Feature                       | Regular Inner Class              | Anonymous Inner Class         |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Name                          | Has a name                      | No name                       |
| Instantiation                 | Can be instantiated multiple times | Can be instantiated only once |
| Constructor                    | Can have constructors            | Cannot have constructors       |
| Access                        | Can access outer class members   | Can also access outer class members |
| Implementation                | Can implement multiple interfaces | Can implement only one interface |

### Use Cases
- **Event Handling**: Commonly used in GUI applications to handle events.
- **Thread Creation**: Often used to create threads with specific behavior.

### Conclusion
Anonymous classes provide a convenient way to implement interfaces or extend classes without cluttering your code with additional named classes. They are particularly useful for short-lived tasks where you need to override methods or implement interfaces quickly.

This summary should serve as effective preparation notes for understanding and discussing anonymous classes in Java during interviews.
