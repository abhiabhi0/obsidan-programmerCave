HashMap is a part of the Java Collections Framework and is used to store key-value pairs. It uses a technique called hashing to efficiently retrieve values based on their keys. Understanding how HashMap works internally helps in optimizing its performance and using it effectively in applications.

#### Key Components of HashMap

1. **Array of Buckets**: 
   - HashMap internally uses an array (also called a hash table) to store entries. Each element in the array is referred to as a "bucket."
   - The default initial capacity of a HashMap is 16, and it can grow dynamically when the number of entries exceeds a certain threshold (load factor).

2. **Node Class**: 
   - Each bucket in the array can hold multiple entries in the form of linked lists (or trees in case of many collisions). Each entry is represented by an instance of the `Node` class.
   - The `Node` class contains:
     - **Key**: The key associated with the value.
     - **Value**: The value associated with the key.
     - **Hash**: The hash code of the key.
     - **Next**: A reference to the next node in case of collisions.

```java
static class Node<K, V> {
    final int hash; // Hash code of the key
    final K key;    // Key
    V value;        // Value
    Node<K, V> next; // Reference to the next node
}
```

#### How Hashing Works

1. **Hash Code Calculation**:
   - When a key-value pair is added to the HashMap using the `put()` method, the hash code for the key is calculated using the `hashCode()` method.
   - This hash code is then processed to compute an index for storing the entry in the array.

```java
static final int hash(Object key) {
    int h;
    return (key == null) ? 0 : (h = key.hashCode()) ^ (h >>> 16);
}
```

2. **Index Calculation**:
   - The computed hash value is used to determine the index in the array where the entry will be stored. This is done using a modulus operation based on the current size of the array.

```java
int index = hash(key) & (array.length - 1); // For example, if length is 16, then mask with 15
```

#### Put Operation

When adding a new key-value pair using `put(K key, V value)`:

1. Calculate the hash code for the key.
2. Determine the index using the hash code.
3. If no entry exists at that index, create a new node and place it there.
4. If an entry already exists (collision), traverse the linked list at that index:
   - If a node with the same key is found, update its value.
   - If not, append a new node to the list.

```java
public V put(K key, V value) {
    int hash = hash(key);
    int index = indexFor(hash, table.length);
    
    for (Node<K,V> e = table[index]; e != null; e = e.next) {
        if (e.hash == hash && (e.key.equals(key))) {
            V oldValue = e.value;
            e.value = value; // Update existing value
            return oldValue;
        }
    }
    
    addEntry(hash, key, value, index); // Add new entry
    return null;
}
```

#### Get Operation

When retrieving a value using `get(Object key)`:

1. Calculate the hash code for the key.
2. Determine the index using this hash code.
3. Traverse the linked list at that index:
   - Compare each node's key with the provided key.
   - If found, return its associated value; if not found after traversing all nodes, return `null`.

```java
public V get(Object key) {
    int hash = hash(key);
    int index = indexFor(hash, table.length);
    
    for (Node<K,V> e = table[index]; e != null; e = e.next) {
        if (e.hash == hash && (e.key.equals(key))) {
            return e.value; // Return found value
        }
    }
    
    return null; // Key not found
}
```

#### Handling Collisions

Collisions occur when multiple keys map to the same index. HashMap handles collisions using linked lists (or trees if many collisions occur):

- **Linked List**: When multiple entries are stored at one index, they are linked together in a list format.
- **Tree Structure**: In Java 8 and later versions, if a bucket exceeds a certain threshold (8 entries), it converts from a linked list to a balanced tree structure (Red-Black Tree) for improved performance during retrieval.

### Diagrammatic Representation

Hereâ€™s a simple diagram illustrating how HashMap stores entries:

```
+---------------------+
|      HashMap        |
|                     |
| +-----------------+ |
| | Index 0        | | <--- Bucket 0 contains nodes
| | +-------------+ | |
| | | Node A     | | |
| | +-------------+ | |
| | +-------------+ | |
| | | Node B     | | |
| | +-------------+ | |
| +-----------------+ |
|                     |
| +-----------------+ |
| | Index 1        | | <--- Bucket 1 contains nodes
| | +-------------+ | |
| | | Node C     | | |
| +-----------------+ |
+---------------------+
```

### Conclusion

Understanding how HashMap works internally provides insights into its efficiency and performance characteristics. It utilizes hashing for quick access to values based on keys while managing collisions through linked lists or trees. This knowledge enables developers to make informed decisions when choosing data structures and optimizing their applications.

This detailed overview should serve as comprehensive preparation notes for understanding HashMap's internal implementation in Java, suitable for interviews or further study on data structures.
