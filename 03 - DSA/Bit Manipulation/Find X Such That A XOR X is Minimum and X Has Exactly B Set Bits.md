**Problem Statement:**  
Given an integer `A` and an integer `B` (number of set bits), find `X` such that:

1. The number of set bits in `X` is exactly `B`.
2. A⊕XA \oplus X (A XOR X) is minimized.

---

### Key Idea:

To minimize A⊕XA \oplus X, `X` must be as close to `A` as possible.  
The approach depends on the number of set bits in `A` compared to `B`:

- **Case 1:** `Number of set bits(A) < B`  
    `X` will have more set bits than `A`, so `X > A`.
    
- **Case 2:** `Number of set bits(A) >= B`  
    `X` will have fewer or equal set bits to `A`, so `X < A`.
    

---

### Algorithm:

1. **Initialize X:**  
    Start with `X = 0`.
    
2. **Place Set Bits at A’s Positions:**
    
    - Traverse the bits of `A` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB).
    - Place `1` in `X` at the positions where `A` has `1` (set bits).
    - Decrement `B` for every set bit placed in `X`.
3. **If B > 0:**
    
    - If there are still set bits to place (`B > 0`), traverse `A` again from LSB.
    - Place the remaining set bits of `X` at positions where `A` has `0` (unset bits).
    - Start placing from the least significant bit to keep `X` as close to `A` as possible.
4. **Output X.**

### Example:

**Input:**  
`A = 21` (Binary: `10101`), `B = 3`

**Process:**

1. **Step 1 (Place Set Bits at A’s Positions):**
    
    - A = `10101` → Set bits at positions: 0, 2, 4.
    - Place `1` in `X` at these positions: `X = 10100` (Binary).
    - Remaining set bits to place: B=3−2=1B = 3 - 2 = 1.
2. **Step 2 (Place Remaining Set Bits):**
    
    - Place the remaining set bit (`1`) at the first available unset bit in `A`.
    - Result: `X = 10101` (Binary).

**Output:**  
`X = 21` (Binary: `10101`)

### Python Code:

```python
def find_min_xor(A, B):
    X = 0
    count_set_bits = 0

    # Place set bits of A into X
    for i in range(32):
        if (A >> i) & 1:  # Check if A has a set bit at position i
            X |= (1 << i)  # Set the bit in X
            count_set_bits += 1
            if count_set_bits == B:  # Stop if we have placed B set bits
                return X

    # If B > set bits of A, place remaining set bits in unset positions
    for i in range(32):
        if not ((A >> i) & 1):  # Check if A has an unset bit at position i
            X |= (1 << i)  # Set the bit in X
            count_set_bits += 1
            if count_set_bits == B:  # Stop if we have placed B set bits
                break

    return X

# Example Usage
A = 21  # Binary: 10101
B = 3
print("X =", find_min_xor(A, B))  # Output: 21
```

### Go Code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func findMinXor(A int, B int) int {
    X := 0
    countSetBits := 0

    // Place set bits of A into X
    for i := 0; i < 32; i++ {
        if (A>>i)&1 == 1 { // Check if A has a set bit at position i
            X |= (1 << i) // Set the bit in X
            countSetBits++
            if countSetBits == B { // Stop if we have placed B set bits
                return X
            }
        }
    }

    // If B > set bits of A, place remaining set bits in unset positions
    for i := 0; i < 32; i++ {
        if (A>>i)&1 == 0 { // Check if A has an unset bit at position i
            X |= (1 << i) // Set the bit in X
            countSetBits++
            if countSetBits == B { // Stop if we have placed B set bits
                break
            }
        }
    }

    return X
}

func main() {
    A := 21 // Binary: 10101
    B := 3
    fmt.Println("X =", findMinXor(A, B)) // Output: 21
}
```

### Complexity Analysis:

1. **Time Complexity:**
    
    - **Traverse Bits:** O(32)O(32), as we check all bit positions of a 32-bit integer.
    
    **Overall:** O(32)O(32), constant time.
    
2. **Space Complexity:**
    
    - **Extra Space Used:** O(1)O(1), as no additional data structures are used.

---

### Final Notes:

- The solution efficiently finds `X` using bit manipulation without explicitly calculating A⊕XA \oplus X for every candidate.
- This ensures that the solution works in constant time.
