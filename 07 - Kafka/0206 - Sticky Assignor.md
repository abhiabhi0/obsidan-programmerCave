The **Sticky Assignor** is a partition assignment strategy used in Apache Kafka that aims to improve the efficiency of consumer group rebalancing. It ensures that partition assignments are as stable as possible while still achieving a balanced distribution of partitions among consumers. Below are detailed notes to help you prepare for your interview on this topic.

### Key Features of Sticky Assignor

1. **Balanced Assignment**:
   - The Sticky Assignor balances partition assignments among consumers while minimizing the number of partitions that move between consumers during rebalancing. This stability is particularly beneficial for stateful applications that need to maintain their state across rebalances.

2. **Reduced Partition Movement**:
   - Unlike traditional assignors (like Round Robin or Range), which can lead to significant partition shuffling, the Sticky Assignor attempts to keep the same partitions assigned to the same consumers as long as they remain in the group. This reduces the overhead of reprocessing and cleanup associated with moving partitions.

3. **Eager Rebalancing**:
   - The Sticky Assignor follows an eager rebalancing protocol, meaning it revokes all partitions from consumers at the start of a rebalance. However, it tries to assign back the same partitions to the same consumers whenever possible.

### How Sticky Assignor Works

- When a consumer joins or leaves a group, the Sticky Assignor performs the following steps:
  1. **Revocation**: All current partition assignments are revoked from consumers.
  2. **Assignment**: The assignor calculates a new assignment based on current subscriptions and tries to stick previously assigned partitions to their respective consumers if they are still part of the group.
  
- For example, consider three consumers $$C0$$, $$C1$$, and $$C2$$ subscribed to a topic with six partitions $$P0$$, $$P1$$, $$P2$$, $$P3$$, $$P4$$, and $$P5$$:
  
  - Initial Assignment:
    - $$C0: [P0, P1]$$
    - $$C1: [P2, P3]$$
    - $$C2: [P4, P5]$$

  - After a rebalance (e.g., when $$C1$$ leaves):
    - New Assignment:
      - $$C0: [P0, P1, P2]$$ (retains its previous assignments)
      - $$C2: [P3, P4, P5]$$

### Cooperative Sticky Assignor

- Introduced in Kafka version 2.5, the **Cooperative Sticky Assignor** allows for cooperative rebalancing.
- Instead of revoking all partitions at once, it only revokes those that need to be reassigned during a rebalance.
- This method reduces downtime and allows consumers to continue processing messages from their currently assigned partitions while new assignments are being calculated.

### Advantages of Using Sticky Assignor

- **Efficiency**: Reduces the number of partitions that need to be cleaned up or reprocessed after a rebalance.
- **Stability**: Maintains continuity for stateful applications by minimizing changes in partition assignments.
- **Performance Improvement**: By keeping partitions assigned to the same consumer, applications can achieve better performance due to reduced overhead.

### Diagrammatic Representation

Hereâ€™s a simple diagram illustrating how the Sticky Assignor operates during rebalancing:

```
Initial Assignment:
+-------------------+
|       Topic       |
|   Partitions (6)  |
+-------------------+
| P0 | P1 | P2 | P3 |
| P4 | P5 |           |
+-------------------+
       / | \
      /  |  \
     C0  C1  C2
     
After Consumer Leaves (C1):
+-------------------+
|       Topic       |
|   Partitions (6)  |
+-------------------+
| P0 | P1 | P2 | P3 |
| P4 | P5 |           |
+-------------------+
       / | \
      /  |  \
     C0  C2
```

### Conclusion

The Sticky Assignor is an effective strategy for managing partition assignments in Kafka consumer groups, especially for applications requiring stability during rebalances. Understanding its mechanisms and benefits will enable you to discuss its advantages and use cases confidently during your interview.
