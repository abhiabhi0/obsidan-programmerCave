**Vector Database Overview:**
- Store and retrieve vectors representing high-dimensional points. [[Vector Search]]
- Utilize k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) indexes for efficient nearest-neighbor lookup.
- Implement algorithms like Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) and Inverted File Index (IVF).

**Importance of Vector Databases:**
- Index vectors generated by embeddings for finding similar assets. [[Vector Embeddings]]
- Enable developers to create unique application experiences (e.g., image search on smartphones).
- Support automated metadata extraction from content and hybrid search on keywords and vectors.

**Usage of Vector Databases:**
- Power vector search use cases like visual, semantic, and multimodal search.
- Paired with generative AI text models for conversational search experiences.
- Development process involves building embedding models, importing data, and utilizing k-NN indexes for efficient retrieval.
- Apply distance functions like cosine to rank results by similarity.
