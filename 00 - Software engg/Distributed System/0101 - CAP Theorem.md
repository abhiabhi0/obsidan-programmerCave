#### **1. CAP Theorem Overview**
- **CAP** stands for **Consistency**, **Availability**, and **Partition Tolerance**.
- **Theorem Statement**: In a distributed system, you can only guarantee **two out of three** properties simultaneously during a **network partition**.
- **Key Insight**: Network partitions (P) are unavoidable in distributed systems. During a partition, the system must choose between **C** (consistency) or **A** (availability).

---

#### **2. Definitions**
- **Consistency (C)**:
  - All nodes see the **same data at the same time**.
  - Every read receives the **most recent write** or an error.
  - Example: After writing to Node A, a read from Node B returns the updated value.

- **Availability (A)**:
  - Every request receives a **non-error response**, but data may not be the latest.
  - The system remains operational **even if some nodes fail**.

- **Partition Tolerance (P)**:
  - The system continues to function **despite network failures** (e.g., dropped messages, node crashes).
  - Partitions are unavoidable in distributed systems (so **P is mandatory**).

---

#### **3. CAP Trade-offs**
- **CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)**:
  - Sacrifices availability during partitions.
  - Example: A banking system ensures transactions are accurate (consistent) but may become temporarily unavailable during network issues.
  - Databases: MongoDB, HBase, Redis (CP configurations).

- **AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)**:
  - Sacrifices consistency during partitions.
  - Example: A social media app remains available during outages but may show stale posts.
  - Databases: Cassandra, DynamoDB, CouchDB.

- **CA (Consistency + Availability)**:
  - Not practical for distributed systems. CA systems assume no partitions (e.g., single-node databases like MySQL in non-replicated setups).

---

#### **5. Real-World Examples**
- **CP Systems**:
  - **MongoDB**: Prioritizes consistency with leader election during partitions.
  - **HBase**: Strong consistency via a single master node.
- **AP Systems**:
  - **Cassandra**: Uses eventual consistency; stays available during partitions.
  - **DynamoDB**: Offers tunable consistency (AP by default).

---

#### **6. Key Concepts**
- **Eventual Consistency** (AP systems):
  - Data becomes consistent **after partitions heal** (e.g., social media feeds).
- **BASE** (Alternative to ACID):
  - **B**asically **A**vailable, **S**oft state, **E**ventual consistency.
- **PACELC** Extension:
  - If **P**artition occurs, choose between **A**vailability and **C**onsistency (**PAC**).  
  - **E**lse (**L**atency vs. **C**onsistency) during normal operations.

#### **7. Common Interview Questions**
1. **Explain CAP Theorem and its implications**.  
   *Focus on trade-offs during partitions and real-world examples.*

2. **Can a distributed system be both CA?**  
   *No. Partitions are inevitable, so true CA systems are non-distributed (e.g., single-node DBs).*

3. **Why is DynamoDB considered AP?**  
   *It prioritizes availability and eventual consistency during partitions.*

4. **How does a CP system handle a partition?**  
   *It blocks requests to avoid inconsistency (e.g., MongoDB elects a new primary node).*

---

#### **8. Misconceptions**
- **Myth**: ‚ÄúYou always have to sacrifice one of C, A, or P.‚Äù  
  *Truth: The trade-off only applies **during a partition**.*
- **Myth**: ‚ÄúAP systems are never consistent.‚Äù  
  *Truth: They achieve **eventual consistency** after partitions resolve.*

---

#### **9. How to Choose CP vs. AP**
- **CP Use Cases**: Financial systems, inventory management (consistency critical).
- **AP Use Cases**: Social media, IoT sensors (availability over consistency).
