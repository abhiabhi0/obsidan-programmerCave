- REST is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web.
- RESTful systems are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server. 
- Separation of client and server allows for independent changes on either side. 
- REST separates user interface concerns from data storage concerns. 
- RESTful systems are stateless, meaning the server does not need to know the client's state. 
- In REST, clients send requests to retrieve or modify resources, and servers send responses. 
- There are four basic HTTP verbs used in requests: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. 
- Headers in requests contain the type of content the client can receive from the server. 
- Responses from the server contain status codes to alert the client to information about the success of the operation. 
- Content types in responses indicate the type of data being sent in the response body.

RESTful systems, being stateless means that each request from a client to the server must contain all the information the server needs to understand and process the request. The server does not store any context or session information between requests.
