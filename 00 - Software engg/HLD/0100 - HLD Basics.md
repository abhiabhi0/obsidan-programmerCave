### **System Design Overview**

- **What is System Design?**
    - **Low-Level Design (LLD):** Focuses on the internal structure of individual components or code within a single service.
    - **High-Level Design (HLD):** Focuses on the design of multiple components/services to achieve a scalable and efficient system.

### **Distributed Systems**

#### **Why are Distributed Systems Needed?**

1. **Initial Setup:**
    - Example: Del.icio.us started as a bookmarking service on a single laptop.
    - Initial setup involves implementing simple functions like:
        - `addBookmark(userId, site_url)`
        - `getAllBookmarks(userId)`
        
1. **Challenges in Scaling:**
    - **Domain Resolution:**
        - Domain names need to resolve to IP addresses via a system like DNS.
        - DNS maintains decentralized copies of centrally stored data to prevent single points of failure.

    - **Downtime During Deployment:**
        - Load balancers can route traffic to healthy machines and handle requests evenly during updates.

    - **Storage Constraints:**
        - Sharding is used to distribute data across multiple machines when storage becomes a bottleneck.

### **Key Concepts in Distributed Systems**

#### **DNS (Domain Name System):**

- Maps domain names to IP addresses.
- DNS servers store a replicated copy of central data from ICANN and update periodically.
#### **Load Balancers:**

- Split traffic among multiple servers and handle failovers.
- Techniques:
    - Health checks/heartbeats to track server availability.
    - Load balancing algorithms: Round-robin, Weighted Round-robin, IP Hashing.
    - [[Types of load balancing algorithms]]

#### **Sharding:**

- Splitting data across multiple machines based on a **sharding key**.
    - **Example:** Using `user_id` ensures all a userâ€™s bookmarks stay on one machine.
- **Constraints:**
    - Lightweight mapping of user IDs to shards.
    - Avoid load skew and ensure even data distribution.
    - Support dynamic shard addition/removal with minimal downtime.
    - [[Database Sharding]]

### **Sharding Approaches**

1. **Modulo-Based Sharding:**  
    `userId % number_of_shards`
    
    - Pros: Simple.
    - Cons: Major data reshuffling when shards are added/removed.
2. **Range-Based Sharding:**
    
    - Pros: Easy to understand.
    - Cons: Load skew as user activity grows unevenly across ranges.
3. **Consistent Hashing:**
    
    - Maps user IDs to a circular hash space and assigns users to the nearest machine in the cycle.
    - **Improved Design:** Use multiple hash points per machine to distribute load evenly when a shard fails.

### **Consistent Hashing Details**

- Nodes are assigned multiple positions on the hash ring using different hash functions.
- Benefits:
    - Failure of one node spreads its load across multiple other nodes, avoiding cascading failures.
    - Helps in balancing load when nodes are added/removed.
