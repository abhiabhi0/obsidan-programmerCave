### **1. High Throughput and Low Latency**

- **Requirement:**  
    The system needed to handle a large volume of data being produced and consumed in real-time.
- **How Kafka Helps:**
    - Kafka is designed to handle millions of messages per second with low latencies, making it ideal for real-time processing.
    - Its efficient I/O operations (using sequential disk writes) ensure consistent performance even under heavy loads.

---
### **2. Durability and Reliability**

- **Requirement:**  
    Reliable message delivery was critical to ensure data was processed and updated without loss.
- **How Kafka Helps:**
    - Kafka persists all messages on disk, ensuring durability.
    - Messages remain in Kafka topics until explicitly deleted based on a retention policy, allowing consumers to reprocess messages if needed.
    - Replication across brokers ensures fault tolerance.

---
### **3. Scalability**

- **Requirement:**  
    The system needed to scale horizontally to handle an  higher traffic.
- **How Kafka Helps:**
    - Kafka's partitioning mechanism allows topics to be divided into multiple partitions, enabling parallel processing across consumers.
    - Producers and consumers can scale independently, ensuring flexibility as the system grows.

---
### **4. Fault Tolerance**

- **Requirement:**  
    The system needed to handle broker or consumer failures gracefully without data loss.
- **How Kafka Helps:**
    - Replicated partitions across brokers ensure high availability.
    - Consumer group mechanisms allow a different consumer instance to take over processing if one fails.

---
### **5. Message Delivery Guarantees**

- **Requirement:**  
    It was important to ensure at-least-once or exactly-once message processing for user offers.
- **How Kafka Helps:**
    - Supports different levels of delivery guarantees (`at-most-once`, `at-least-once`, and `exactly-once`).
    - Configuring `acks=all` in the producer ensures messages are acknowledged by all replicas before being marked as delivered.

---
### **6. Integration with the gRPC Service**

- **Requirement:**  
    The messaging system needed to seamlessly integrate with the gRPC service to produce and consume messages efficiently.
- **How Kafka Helps:**
    - Kafka's client libraries (e.g., Confluent Kafka for Go) provide easy integration for producing messages.
    - Consumers can subscribe to topics and process messages in real-time, ensuring dynamic updates to user offer codes.

---
### **7. Stream Processing Capabilities**

- **Requirement:**  
    The ability to process and transform data streams in real time (e.g., aggregating user offer data).
- **How Kafka Helps:**
    - Kafka Streams provides a lightweight library for stream processing, enabling real-time transformations without additional systems.
    - Compatible with other stream processing tools like Apache Flink and Apache Spark.

---
### **8. Decoupling and Microservices Architecture**

- **Requirement:**  
    To enable independent development and scaling of services, the system required loose coupling between components.
- **How Kafka Helps:**
    - Kafka acts as a middle layer, decoupling producers (gRPC service) from consumers (e.g., database update service).
    - Services can evolve independently as long as they adhere to the agreed topic schema.

---
### **9. Monitoring and Observability**

- **Requirement:**  
    The ability to monitor message processing and identify bottlenecks.
- **How Kafka Helps:**
    - Kafka exposes metrics for producers, consumers, brokers, and topics that can be monitored using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog.
    - Lag monitoring ensures that consumers are processing messages in a timely manner.

---
### **10. Industry Proven and Open Source**

- **Requirement:**  
    A mature, battle-tested, and cost-effective messaging system.
- **How Kafka Helps:**
    - Kafka is widely adopted in industries like e-commerce, finance, and technology, proving its robustness.
    - Its open-source nature makes it cost-effective, with the option to use commercial distributions (e.g., Confluent) for additional features.

### **Example Usage in the System**

1. **Producer Side (gRPC Service):**  
    The gRPC service produces user offer messages to the Kafka topic `user-offers`.
    
    ```go
    producer.Produce(&kafka.Message{
        TopicPartition: kafka.TopicPartition{Topic: &"user-offers", Partition: kafka.PartitionAny},
        Value:          []byte(serializedMessage),
    }, nil)
    ```
    
2. **Consumer Side:**  
    Consumers read these messages, deserialize them, and update user offer codes dynamically in the database.
    
    ```go
    consumer.SubscribeTopics([]string{"user-offers"}, nil)
    for {
        msg, err := consumer.ReadMessage(-1)
        if err == nil {
            processMessage(msg)
        }
    }
    ```
