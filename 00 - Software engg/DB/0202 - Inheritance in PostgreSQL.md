PostgreSQL is classified as an **Object-Relational Database Management System (ORDBMS)** because it combines the principles of relational databases with object-oriented features. This allows PostgreSQL to handle complex data types and relationships more effectively than traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS).

## Characteristics of PostgreSQL as an ORDBMS

1. **Complex Data Types**: PostgreSQL supports a wide range of data types, including composite types, arrays, and JSONB. This enables users to model complex data structures directly within the database[2][3].

2. **User-Defined Types**: Users can define their own data types, which allows for greater flexibility in how data is stored and manipulated[4][5].

3. **Inheritance**: One of the standout features of PostgreSQL is table inheritance, which allows a table (child) to inherit columns from another table (parent). This means that a child table can have all the attributes of the parent table while also adding its own specific attributes.

4. **Advanced Query Capabilities**: PostgreSQL supports advanced querying features such as full-text search, and it allows for the use of object-oriented programming concepts in SQL queries[3][4].

## Table Inheritance in PostgreSQL

Table inheritance in PostgreSQL allows for a hierarchical relationship between tables:

- **Creating Parent and Child Tables**: When you create a child table, you can specify that it inherits from a parent table. The child table automatically receives all columns from the parent table.

### Example of Table Inheritance

```sql
-- Create a parent table
CREATE TABLE vehicle (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    make VARCHAR(50),
    model VARCHAR(50),
    year INT
);

-- Create a child table that inherits from the vehicle table
CREATE TABLE car (
    doors INT
) INHERITS (vehicle);
```

In this example:
- The `car` table inherits all columns from the `vehicle` table (`id`, `make`, `model`, `year`) and adds an additional column `doors`.
  
### Querying Inherited Tables

When querying the child table, you can access both its own columns and those inherited from the parent:

```sql
SELECT * FROM car;
```

This query will return all columns from both the `car` and `vehicle` tables.

### Benefits of Table Inheritance

- **Code Reusability**: Common attributes can be defined once in the parent table.
- **Polymorphism**: You can treat child tables as if they were instances of the parent table, allowing for more flexible querying.
- **Data Organization**: Helps organize data hierarchically, making it easier to manage complex datasets.

In summary, PostgreSQL's classification as an ORDBMS is due to its ability to handle complex data types and relationships through features like user-defined types and table inheritance, making it a powerful choice for applications requiring advanced data modeling capabilities.
