### Summary:
- **Basic Authentication**:
    - Sends username and password with each request.
    - Less secure without encryption (use with HTTPS).
    - **When to use**: Simple apps with low security needs or over secured connections.
- **Token Authentication**:
    - Uses tokens (e.g., JWT) to authenticate without sending credentials in each request.
    - **When to use**: Secure, scalable systems; avoids sending credentials frequently.
- **OAuth Authentication**:
    - Grants third-party limited access to user resources with access tokens.
    - **When to use**: Third-party integrations or controlled resource access by external apps.
- **API Key Authentication**:
    - Uses unique keys for access, sent in headers/parameters.
    - Less secure than token-based or OAuth.
    - **When to use**: Simple access control for less sensitive environments.

### 1. Basic Authentication: 
Involves sending a username and password with each request, but can be less secure without encryption.
#### When to use: 
Suitable for simple applications where security and encryption arenâ€™t the primary concern or when used over secured connections.

### 2. Token Authentication: 
Uses generated tokens, like JSON Web Tokens (JWT), exchanged between client and server, offering enhanced security without sending login credentials with each request.
#### When to use: 
Ideal for more secure and scalable systems, especially when avoiding sending login credentials with each request is a priority.

### 3. OAuth Authentication: 
Enables third-party limited access to user resources without revealing credentials by issuing access tokens after user authentication.
#### When to use: 
Ideal for scenarios requiring controlled access to user resources by third-party applications or services.

### 4. API Key Authentication: 
Assigns unique keys to users or applications, sent in headers or parameters; while simple, it might lack the security features of token-based or OAuth methods.
#### When to use: 
Convenient for straightforward access control in less sensitive environments or for granting access to certain functionalities without the need for user-specific permissions.
