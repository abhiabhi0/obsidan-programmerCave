### Key Differences

- **Protocol**:
  - **gRPC**: Utilizes HTTP/2, allowing multiplexing, which enables multiple requests and responses over a single connection.
  - **REST**: Typically uses HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2, but is primarily text-based.

- **Data Format**:
  - **gRPC**: Employs Protocol Buffers (binary format), leading to smaller payload sizes and faster serialization.
  - **REST**: Generally uses JSON (text-based format), which is more human-readable but larger in size compared to binary formats.

- **Performance**:
  - **gRPC**: Known for high performance, especially in low-latency and high-throughput scenarios due to its efficient data serialization and HTTP/2 features.
  - **REST**: Offers good performance but may not match gRPC in scenarios involving large data transfers or real-time communications.

- **Communication Model**:
  - **gRPC**: Supports various types of communication including unary, server streaming, client streaming, and bi-directional streaming.
  - **REST**: Primarily follows a request-response model (unary), where each request from the client waits for a response from the server.

- **Client-Server Coupling**:
  - **gRPC**: Tightly coupled; both client and server must share the same proto file for communication.
  - **REST**: Loosely coupled; changes on the server side do not necessarily require client updates.

### Advantages

- **gRPC**:
  - Built-in code generation from service definitions, streamlining development.
  - Strongly typed interfaces enhance validation and error handling.
  - Better suited for internal microservices communication in cloud-native environments.

- **REST**:
  - Simplicity and ease of understanding make it a popular choice for public APIs.
  - Flexibility in data formats (supports XML, HTML, etc.) allows for broader use cases.
  - Easier to crawl and interact with using standard web tools (e.g., browsers).

### Use Cases

- **gRPC**:
  - Best for high-performance systems requiring real-time data exchange.
  - Suitable for microservices architectures with multiple programming languages.
  - Ideal for applications with large data loads or needing efficient communication between services.

- **REST**:
  - Commonly used for public-facing APIs due to its simplicity and wide adoption.
  - Well-suited for web-based architectures and simple data communications.
  
Understanding these differences will help you articulate the strengths and weaknesses of gRPC compared to RESTful APIs during your interview.
