- **Definition**: gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is an open-source high-performance RPC framework designed by Google, facilitating efficient communication between distributed applications as if they were local function calls[2][3].

- **Service Definition**: The first step in gRPC development involves defining a service interface using an Interface Definition Language (IDL), typically Protocol Buffers (protobuf). This definition includes the methods available for remote invocation and their parameters[1][5].

- **Key Features**:
  - **Protocol Buffers**: A language-neutral and platform-neutral method for serializing structured data, which enhances performance compared to JSON or XML[6].
  - **HTTP/2 Support**: gRPC uses HTTP/2, which allows multiplexed streams, header compression, and server push capabilities, significantly improving throughput and performance over HTTP/1.1[2][3].
  - **Streaming Support**: It supports various communication types including unary, server streaming, client streaming, and bi-directional streaming, allowing flexible interaction patterns[4][5].

- **Communication Models**:
  - **Unary RPC**: Single request-response interaction.
  - **Server Streaming RPC**: Client sends a request and receives a stream of responses.
  - **Client Streaming RPC**: Client sends a series of requests and receives a single response.
  - **Bi-directional Streaming RPC**: Both client and server can send messages independently[2][5].

- **Advantages of gRPC**:
  - **High Efficiency**: Reduces message size with binary serialization and allows multiple requests over a single connection due to HTTP/2[2].
  - **Cross-Language Support**: Compatible with multiple programming languages like Java, Python, C++, Go, etc., enabling diverse service integration[3].
  - **Built-in Features**: Includes support for authentication, load balancing, retries, and timeouts without needing additional configurations[2][6].

- **Adoption and Use Cases**: Widely adopted by major tech companies for microservices architecture due to its scalability and performance benefits. It is suitable for various applications including web services, mobile applications, and IoT systems[3][7].

- **Development Workflow**:
  - Define the service in a `.proto` file.
  - Generate server-side code from the service definition.
  - Implement the server logic to handle client requests.
  - Create client stubs to facilitate communication with the server[4][9].
