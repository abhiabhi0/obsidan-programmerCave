### RDBMS vs ORDBMS
- **RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)**:
  - Based on the relational model of data.
  - Examples: SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle.
  - Ideal for traditional application tasks like data processing and administration.
  - Primarily handles structured data.

- **ORDBMS (Object-Relational Database Management System)**:
  - Based on the relational model with additional support for object-oriented concepts.
  - Incorporates classes, objects, and inheritance.
  - Example: PostgreSQL.
  - Suitable for applications with complex objects.
  - Can handle new data types like video, audio, and image files.

- **Comparison**:
  - RDBMS excels in traditional data management and structured data handling.
  - ORDBMS provides extended capabilities to manage complex and unstructured data types.
