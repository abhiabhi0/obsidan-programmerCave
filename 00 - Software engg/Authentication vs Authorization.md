Authentication is verifying the true identity of a user or entity, while authorization determines what a user can access and ensures that a user or entity receives the right access or permissions in a system.  Authentication is a prerequisite to authorization.

**Authentication** is the process of verifying that a user is who they claim to be. For example, when you go through security at an airport, you show your ID to authenticate your identity.

**Authorization** is the process of determining if a user is allowed to perform certain actions or access certain resources or data. For example, an airline needs to determine which people can come on board.
