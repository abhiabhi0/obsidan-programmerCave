| Parameters            | DELETE Command                                                                                                                              | DROP Command                                                                                                                                                                                  | TRUNCATE Command                                                                                                                                    |

| Language              | The DELETE command is Data Manipulation Language Command.                                                                                   | The DROP command is Data Definition Language Command.                                                                                                                                         | The TRUNCATE command is a Data Definition Language Command.                                                                                         |
| Use                   | The DELETE command deletes one or more existing records from the table in the database.                                                     | The DROP Command drops the complete table from the database.                                                                                                                                  | The TRUNCATE Command deletes all the rows from the existing table, leaving the row with the column names.                                           |
| Transition            | We can restore any deleted row or multiple rows from the database using the ROLLBACK command.                                               | We cannot get the complete table deleted from the database using the ROLLBACK command.                                                                                                        | We cannot restore all the deleted rows from the database using the ROLLBACK command.                                                                |
| Memory Space          | The DELETE command does not free the allocated space of the table from memory.                                                              | The DROP command removes the space allocated for the table from memory.                                                                                                                       | The TRUNCATE command does not free the space allocated for the table from memory.                                                                   |
| Performance Speed     | The DELETE command performs slower than the DROP command and TRUNCATE command as it deletes one or more rows based on a specific condition. | The DROP Command has faster performance than DELETE Command but not as compared to the Truncate Command because the DROP command deletes the table from the database after deleting the rows. | The TRUNCATE command works faster than the DROP command and DELETE command because it deletes all the records from the table without any condition. |
| Integrity Constraints | The Integrity Constraints remain the same in the DELETE command.                                                                            | The Integrity Constraints get removed for the DROP command.                                                                                                                                   | The Integrity Constraints will not get removed from the TRUNCATE command.                                                                           |
| Permission            | DELETE permission is required to delete the rows of the table.                                                                              | We need ALTER permission on the schema to which the table belongs and CONTROL permission on the table to use the DROP command.                                                                | We need table ALTER permission to use the TRUNCATE command.                                                                                         |
| Syntax                | DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;                                                                                                     | DROP TABLE table_name;                                                                                                                                                                        | TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;                                                                                                                          |
