### **Project Overview**

The project was a **microservices-based application** built using **Go** (Golang), and it was deployed on **Kubernetes**. The services were containerized using **Docker**, and the pipeline was designed to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the application to a staging and production environment.

### **CI/CD Tools Used**

- **Source Control**: GitHub (for version control and source code management)
- **CI Tool**: GitHub Actions (for Continuous Integration)
- **CD Tool**: Kubernetes with Helm (for Continuous Deployment)
- **Containerization**: Docker (for containerizing the services)
- **Artifact Repository**: Docker Hub (for storing Docker images)
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Prometheus and Grafana (for monitoring and metrics)
- **Notifications**: Slack (for alerting and notifications)

### **1. Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline**

#### **A. GitHub Actions Workflow**

The CI pipeline was configured using GitHub Actions. The workflow was triggered every time a push was made to the repository or a pull request was opened.

Here’s a basic structure of the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file:

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Go
      uses: actions/setup-go@v2
      with:
        go-version: '1.18'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        go mod tidy
        go mod vendor

    - name: Run tests
      run: go test ./...

    - name: Build Docker image
      run: |
        docker build -t my-app:$GITHUB_SHA .
        docker tag my-app:$GITHUB_SHA my-dockerhub-user/my-app:$GITHUB_SHA

    - name: Push Docker image to Docker Hub
      run: |
        docker login -u $DOCKER_USER -p $DOCKER_PASSWORD
        docker push my-dockerhub-user/my-app:$GITHUB_SHA

    - name: Upload Build Artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: docker-image
        path: path/to/artifacts/
```

#### **Key Steps in CI Pipeline:**

1. **Checkout the Code**: The first step checks out the code from the repository to the runner.
2. **Set up Go**: We specify the Go version needed for the project.
3. **Install Dependencies**: We run `go mod tidy` and `go mod vendor` to ensure that all dependencies are correctly managed.
4. **Run Tests**: Automated unit tests are run using `go test`.
5. **Build Docker Image**: We build the Docker image with a tag based on the commit SHA (`$GITHUB_SHA`).
6. **Push Docker Image**: The image is pushed to **Docker Hub** for storage.
7. **Upload Build Artifacts**: Any required build artifacts (e.g., logs or reports) are uploaded.

---

### **2. Continuous Deployment (CD) Pipeline**

Once the CI pipeline is successfully executed, the **CD pipeline** deploys the Docker image to the staging or production environment.

#### **A. Kubernetes and Helm for Deployment**

We used **Kubernetes** for container orchestration and **Helm** for managing Kubernetes applications. The deployment was automated using a GitHub Action for deploying the Docker image to the Kubernetes cluster.

Here’s how the deployment step was integrated into the GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
deploy:
  needs: build
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  environment: production

  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Helm
      uses: azure/setup-helm@v1

    - name: Set up kubectl
      uses: engineerd/setup-kubectl@v1

    - name: Configure kubectl
      run: |
        kubectl config set-cluster my-cluster --server=$K8S_API_SERVER --certificate-authority=$K8S_CA_CERT
        kubectl config set-credentials my-user --token=$K8S_TOKEN
        kubectl config set-context my-context --cluster=my-cluster --user=my-user
        kubectl config use-context my-context

    - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
      run: |
        helm upgrade --install my-app ./helm/my-app --set image.tag=$GITHUB_SHA --namespace production
```

#### **Key Steps in CD Pipeline:**

1. **Set up Helm and kubectl**: Helm and kubectl are installed to manage Kubernetes deployments.
2. **Configure kubectl**: The Kubernetes cluster credentials (API server, token, and CA certificate) are configured.
3. **Deploy to Kubernetes**: Using Helm, the application is deployed or updated with the latest Docker image tag (`$GITHUB_SHA`). The Helm chart was used to define all Kubernetes resources such as Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps.

### **3. Rollback Strategy**

- The CD pipeline also includes rollback logic in case of a failure. If the deployment fails, the pipeline rolls back the changes by reverting to the previous working version of the Docker image in Kubernetes using Helm.

Example:

```yaml
    - name: Rollback if deployment fails
      if: failure()
      run: |
        helm rollback my-app 1 --namespace production
```

---

### **4. Monitoring and Alerts**

- After deployment, the application is monitored for any issues using **Prometheus** for metrics collection and **Grafana** for dashboards.
- Alerts are set up to notify the team via **Slack** if there are any issues with the deployed application, such as increased error rates or high latency.

Example Slack notification:

```yaml
    - name: Notify via Slack
      uses: rtCamp/action-slack-notify@v2
      with:
        slack_webhook_url: $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
        message: "Deployment to production failed for $GITHUB_SHA"
      if: failure()
```

---

### **5. GitOps Approach (Optional)**

For more advanced setups, I’ve also implemented a **GitOps** approach where the CD pipeline is triggered automatically when changes are made to deployment files stored in a Git repository. Using tools like **ArgoCD** or **Flux**, changes in the repository automatically trigger the deployment process to Kubernetes.

---

### **6. Best Practices Followed**

1. **Branching Strategy**:
    - Followed the GitFlow branching model: Feature branches, `staging` branch, and `main` branch.
2. **Automated Tests**:
    - Ensured that unit tests, integration tests, and linting checks are part of the pipeline to ensure code quality.
3. **Containerization**:
    - Ensured that all services were containerized using Docker, which allows easy deployment across different environments.
4. **Immutable Infrastructure**:
    - Made sure to use immutable Docker images for deployments to prevent configuration drift.
5. **Rollback Mechanism**:
    - Provided an automated rollback mechanism using Helm to ensure quick recovery in case of a failed deployment.

### **Conclusion**

This CI/CD pipeline setup ensures that the entire process, from code commit to production deployment, is automated and efficient. By leveraging GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm, I created a robust and scalable pipeline that helped streamline the development workflow, improve deployment speed, and reduce errors. The monitoring and alerting setup ensured that the system remained highly available and performant, with quick recovery in case of failures.
