## Overview of Distributed Caching System
A distributed caching system stores frequently accessed data across multiple nodes to reduce latency and improve application performance. It operates on the principle of caching data in memory, allowing quick retrieval while managing high traffic loads.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Read and Write Operations**: Quickly retrieve and store data in the cache.
2. **Eviction Policy**: Implement policies such as Least Recently Used (LRU) or Least Frequently Used (LFU) to manage cache size.
3. **Replication**: Ensure data is replicated across nodes for fault tolerance.
4. **Data Consistency**: Support eventual consistency across distributed nodes.

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Scalability**: The system should scale horizontally by adding more nodes.
2. **Availability**: Ensure high availability, allowing the system to remain operational even during node failures.
3. **Partition Tolerance**: The system should continue functioning despite network partitions.

## High-Level Architecture

### Components
1. **Cache Nodes**: Servers that store cached data in-memory.
2. **Client Library**: Interfaces with cache nodes for read/write operations.
3. **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming requests among cache nodes to balance load.
4. **Data Store**: Persistent backend database for fallback during cache misses.
5. **Monitoring Tools**: Track performance metrics and health of cache nodes.

## Design Considerations

### Data Distribution and Consistency
1. **Consistent Hashing**:
   - Use consistent hashing to distribute data evenly across cache nodes, minimizing data movement when nodes are added or removed.

2. **Replication Strategies**:
   - Implement master-slave replication where each shard has a primary node (master) for writes and multiple replicas for reads.
   - In case of a master failure, a leader election process can promote one of the replicas to master, ensuring availability.

3. **Eventual Consistency**:
   - Allow temporary inconsistencies between replicas, with mechanisms to synchronize updates periodically (e.g., using background processes or gossip protocols).

### Eviction Policies
- Implement LRU or LFU eviction policies to manage memory efficiently and ensure that frequently accessed data remains in the cache.

### Handling Failures
- Use health checks to monitor node status and automatically remove failed nodes from the load balancer's pool.
- Implement fallback mechanisms that redirect requests to the persistent data store when a cache miss occurs.

### Scalability Strategies
1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Dynamically add or remove cache nodes based on load, using consistent hashing to redistribute cached data with minimal disruption.

2. **Load Balancing**:
   - Use a load balancer to evenly distribute requests across available cache nodes, preventing overload on any single node.

3. **Sharding**:
   - Divide the dataset into smaller shards that can be managed independently across different nodes, allowing parallel processing of requests.

## Conclusion
Designing a distributed caching system involves balancing the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance as outlined by the CAP theorem. By implementing strategies such as consistent hashing, replication, and dynamic scaling, you can create a robust caching solution that significantly improves performance for high-traffic web applications while ensuring eventual consistency across distributed nodes. This foundational understanding will prepare you for your interview on this topic effectively.
