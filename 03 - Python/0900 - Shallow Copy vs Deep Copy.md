#### 1. **Shallow Copy**

- **Definition**: Creates a new object but references the original objectâ€™s nested objects.
- **Behavior**:
    - Changes made to mutable elements in the copied object affect the original object, and vice versa.
- **How to Create**:
    - Use the `copy.copy()` function from the `copy` module or the `copy()` method.
- **Example**:
    
    ```python
    import copy
    
    original_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    shallow_copied_list = copy.copy(original_list)
    
    original_list[0][0] = 'a'
    print(original_list)         # Output: [['a', 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    print(shallow_copied_list)   # Output: [['a', 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    ```
    
- **Key Point**: Inner objects (e.g., nested lists) are shared between the original and the shallow copy.

#### 2. **Deep Copy**

- **Definition**: Creates a new object and recursively copies all nested objects from the original.
- **Behavior**:
    - Changes made to any element in the copied object do not affect the original object, and vice versa.
- **How to Create**:
    - Use the `copy.deepcopy()` function from the `copy` module.
- **Example**:
    
    ```python
    import copy
    
    original_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    deep_copied_list = copy.deepcopy(original_list)
    
    original_list[0][0] = 'a'
    print(original_list)        # Output: [['a', 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    print(deep_copied_list)     # Output: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    ```
    
- **Key Point**: Inner objects are completely independent copies.

#### 3. **Comparison**

|Aspect|Shallow Copy|Deep Copy|
|---|---|---|
|**Object Creation**|New object references original's nested objects.|New object copies all nested objects recursively.|
|**Independence**|Changes in nested objects affect both.|Changes in nested objects do not affect the other.|
|**Performance**|Faster and uses less memory.|Slower and uses more memory.|

---

#### 4. **When to Use**

- **Shallow Copy**: Use when shared references are acceptable, and modifications to nested objects are intentional.
- **Deep Copy**: Use when completely independent copies are required to avoid unintended modifications.

By understanding the differences, you can make informed decisions based on the specific needs of your program.
