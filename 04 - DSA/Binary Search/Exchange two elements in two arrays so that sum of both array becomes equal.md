To solve the problem of exchanging elements between two arrays to make their sums equal, we can use a formula-based approach combined with binary search. Here’s the breakdown:

### Problem Explanation:

1. **Given:**
    
    - Two arrays, `arr1` and `arr2`.
    - Let:
        - Sum of `arr1` = s1s1.
        - Sum of `arr2` = s2s2.
2. **Goal:**
    
    - Swap one element AA from `arr1` with one element BB from `arr2` such that the sum of both arrays becomes equal.
3. **Key Insight:**
    
    - After the swap:
        
        - New sum of `arr1` = s1−A+Bs1 - A + B.
        - New sum of `arr2` = s2−B+As2 - B + A.
    - For the sums to be equal:
        
        s1−A+B=s2−B+As1 - A + B = s2 - B + A
    - Simplifying:
        
        2(A−B)=s1−s22(A - B) = s1 - s2
    - Rearrange:
        
        A=B−s1−s22A = B - \frac{s1 - s2}{2}
    - Here, s1−s22\frac{s1 - s2}{2} must be an integer (which implies s1−s2s1 - s2 is even).

### Approach:

1. **Check Feasibility:**
    
    - If s1−s2s1 - s2 is odd, it’s impossible to make the sums equal.
2. **Sorting for Binary Search:**
    
    - Sort `arr1` to allow efficient binary search.
3. **Iterate Through `arr2`:**
    
    - For every element BB in `arr2`, calculate: A=B−s1−s22A = B - \frac{s1 - s2}{2}
    - Use binary search on `arr1` to check if AA exists.
4. **Time Complexity:**
    
    - Sorting `arr1`: O(N1log⁡N1)O(N_1 \log N_1).
    - For each element in `arr2`, binary search: O(N2log⁡N1)O(N_2 \log N_1).
    - Overall: O((N1+N2)log⁡N1)O((N_1 + N_2) \log N_1).

### Algorithm:

1. Calculate s1s1 and s2s2.
2. Check if s1−s2s1 - s2 is even.
    - If odd, return "Not Possible."
3. Sort `arr1`.
4. Iterate over `arr2`, and for each element BB:
    - Compute A=B−(s1−s2)/2A = B - (s1 - s2)/2.
    - Use binary search to check if AA exists in `arr1`.
    - If found, return AA and BB.

### Code (in Python):

```python
def find_swap_values(arr1, arr2):
    # Calculate sums of both arrays
    s1 = sum(arr1)
    s2 = sum(arr2)

    # Difference must be even
    if (s1 - s2) % 2 != 0:
        return "Not Possible"

    # Target difference to balance arrays
    target = (s1 - s2) // 2

    # Sort arr1 for binary search
    arr1.sort()

    # Helper function for binary search
    def binary_search(arr, x):
        low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if arr[mid] == x:
                return True
            elif arr[mid] < x:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        return False

    # Check for valid swap
    for B in arr2:
        A = B - target
        if binary_search(arr1, A):
            return A, B

    return "Not Possible"


# Example
arr1 = [4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2]
arr2 = [3, 6, 3, 3]
print(find_swap_values(arr1, arr2))  # Output: (1, 3)
```

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Input:

- `arr1 = [4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2]`
- `arr2 = [3, 6, 3, 3]`

#### Steps:

1. **Calculate Sums:**
    
    - s1=4+1+2+1+1+2=11s1 = 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 11.
    - s2=3+6+3+3=15s2 = 3 + 6 + 3 + 3 = 15.
2. **Check Feasibility:**
    
    - s1−s2=11−15=−4s1 - s2 = 11 - 15 = -4.
    - target=−4/2=−2target = -4 / 2 = -2.
3. **Sort `arr1`:**
    
    - arr1=[1,1,1,2,2,4]arr1 = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4].
4. **Iterate Over `arr2`:**
    
    - For B=3B = 3, A=3−(−2)=5A = 3 - (-2) = 5 → Not in `arr1`.
    - For B=6B = 6, A=6−(−2)=8A = 6 - (-2) = 8 → Not in `arr1`.
    - For B=3B = 3, A=3−(−2)=5A = 3 - (-2) = 5 → Not in `arr1`.
    - For B=3B = 3, A=3−(−2)=5A = 3 - (-2) = 5 → Not in `arr1`.
5. **Output:**
    
    - No valid swaps found.

### Complexity:

1. **Sorting:**
    
    - O(N1log⁡N1)O(N_1 \log N_1).
2. **Binary Search:**
    
    - For N2N_2 elements, O(N2log⁡N1)O(N_2 \log N_1).
