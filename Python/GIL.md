Python Global Interpreter Lock or GIL is an important part of multithreading programming. It is a type of process lock used when working with multiple processes. It gives the control to only one thread. Generally, Python uses a single thread to run a single process. We get the same performance result of the single-threaded and multi-threaded processes using the GIL. It restricts achieving multithreading in Python because it prevents the threads and works as a single thread.
