small anonymous function that can have ==any number of parameters but can only have one expression. ==Lambda functions are defined using the `lambda` keyword, and they are commonly used when you ==need a simple function for a short period of time.==

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8
```
Lambda functions are often used in situations where you ==need to pass a function as an argument to another function, such as with the `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()` functions==. 

They can also be used to define ==small, inline functions without the need for a separate `def` statement.==

```python
# Using lambda with map()
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)
print(list(squared))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Using lambda with filter()
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)
print(list(even_numbers))  # Output: [2, 4]

# Using lambda with sorted()
names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eve']
sorted_names = sorted(names, key=lambda x: len(x))
print(sorted_names)  # Output: ['Bob', 'Alice', 'David', 'Charlie', 'Eve']
```
