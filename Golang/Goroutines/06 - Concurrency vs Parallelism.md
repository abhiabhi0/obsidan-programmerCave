### **Concurrency**:

- **Definition**: The ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously by switching between them (not necessarily at the same time). It's about **managing multiple tasks**.
- **Goal**: To design systems that can handle tasks efficiently.
- **Execution**: Tasks may run on a single processor or multiple processors.
- **Example in Go**: Using Goroutines to handle multiple tasks concurrently, even on a single CPU.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func task(name string) {
	for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
		fmt.Printf("%s: %d\n", name, i)
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
	}
}

func main() {
	go task("Task 1") // Runs concurrently
	go task("Task 2") // Runs concurrently
	time.Sleep(4 * time.Second) // Wait for Goroutines to finish
	fmt.Println("All tasks completed!")
}
```

### **Parallelism**:

- **Definition**: The ability to execute multiple tasks at the exact same time using **multiple CPUs or cores**. It's about **doing tasks at the same time**.
- **Goal**: To improve performance by utilizing multiple processors.
- **Execution**: Tasks must run on a multi-core CPU to achieve parallelism.
- **Example in Go**: Using Goroutines with multiple CPUs.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"runtime"
	"time"
)

func task(name string) {
	for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
		fmt.Printf("%s: %d\n", name, i)
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
	}
}

func main() {
	runtime.GOMAXPROCS(2) // Allow Go runtime to use 2 CPUs
	go task("Task 1")     // Can run in parallel
	go task("Task 2")     // Can run in parallel
	time.Sleep(4 * time.Second) // Wait for Goroutines to finish
	fmt.Println("All tasks completed!")
}
```

### **Key Differences**:

|**Aspect**|**Concurrency**|**Parallelism**|
|---|---|---|
|**Focus**|Task management|Task execution|
|**Execution**|May or may not run simultaneously|Always runs simultaneously|
|**System Support**|Can work on a single core|Requires multi-core processors|
|**Example**|Goroutines on one CPU|Goroutines on multiple CPUs|

In summary, **concurrency** is about **dealing with multiple tasks** at once, while **parallelism** is about **doing multiple tasks** at once. Go's concurrency primitives, like Goroutines and Channels, make it easy to write concurrent programs, and parallelism can be achieved when running on multi-core systems.
