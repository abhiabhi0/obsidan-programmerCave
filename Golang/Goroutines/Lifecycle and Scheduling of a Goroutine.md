#### **1. Key Components in Go Scheduler**

- **G (Goroutine):** Lightweight concurrent threads of execution.
- **M (Machine):** Represents OS threads.
- **P (Processor):** Logical processors that manage goroutines and enable parallelism.

#### **2. Go Scheduler:**

- **M:N Scheduler:**
    - M goroutines are mapped to N OS threads.
    - Executes at most `GOMAXPROCS` threads simultaneously.
- **Global Queue and Local Run Queues:**
    - **Global Queue:** Holds goroutines waiting for execution (checked occasionally).
    - **Local Run Queues:** Each P maintains its own queue for runnable goroutines.
- **Work Stealing:** When a P finishes its queue, it randomly steals goroutines from another P's queue.

#### **3. Lifecycle of a Goroutine**

1. **Creation:** Added to the Local Run Queue of a P.
2. **Execution:** Executed by an M assigned to a P.
3. **Blocking:** Temporarily relinquishes control (e.g., waiting on I/O or synchronization).
4. **Unblocking:** Added back to a Local Run Queue after resolving the blocking operation.
5. **Termination:** Completes execution and frees up resources.

#### **4. Scheduling Algorithm**

1. Look for a runnable goroutine:
    - **Global Queue:** Checked 1/61 of the time for fairness.
    - **Local Queue:** Primary source for scheduling.
    - **Work Stealing:** If local queue is empty, attempts to steal tasks from another P.
2. Execute the runnable goroutine until it blocks.
3. Handle idle and spinning threads to balance resource use:
    - **Spinning Threads:** Keep threads active to minimize preemption and latency.
    - Only up to `GOMAXPROCS` threads can spin at a time.

---

#### **5. Work Sharing vs. Work Stealing**

- **Work Sharing:** Proactively distributes new threads to underutilized processors.
- **Work Stealing:** Underutilized processors actively fetch work from others (used in Go since version 1.1).

---

#### **6. Optimizations in the Scheduler**

- **Minimized Handoff:** Reduces latency and overhead by avoiding frequent thread handoff.
- **Spinning Threads:** Ensures no runnable goroutine is left idle without significant CPU overhead.

Goroutine Lifecycle:
+----------------+          +-----------------+         +----------------+
|   Created      |  ---->  |   Runnable      | ---->   |   Executed      |
+----------------+          +-----------------+         +----------------+
                                 ^   |                         |
                                 |   v                         v
                          +--------------+          +----------------+
                          |   Blocked    | <----->  |   Unblocked    |
                          +--------------+          +----------------+
                                  |
                                  v
                          +----------------+
                          |   Terminated   |
                          +----------------+

Scheduler Workflow:
1. Check Local Run Queue --> Global Queue (1/61 time) --> Steal from others --> Poll Network
2. Execute Goroutine
3. Handle Block/Unblock

Processor P Management:
+-----------+       +-----------+       +-----------+
|  P1: Q1   | <---> |  P2: Q2   | <---> |  P3: Q3   |
+-----------+       +-----------+       +-----------+
