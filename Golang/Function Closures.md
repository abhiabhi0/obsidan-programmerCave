A **closure** in Go is a function value that references variables from outside its body. These variables are captured by the function, allowing the function to "close over" its environment, even after the surrounding scope has exited.

### Key Features of Closures in Go:

1. **Access to Outer Variables**: Closures can access and modify variables defined in their outer scope.
2. **State Retention**: Captured variables persist across multiple calls to the closure, maintaining their state.
3. **Encapsulation**: Closures can be used to encapsulate logic and state.

### Example 1: Simple Closure

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // A function that returns a closure
    adder := func() func(int) int {
        sum := 0
        return func(x int) int {
            sum += x // Access and modify `sum` from outer scope
            return sum
        }
    }

    sumClosure := adder() // Create a closure

    fmt.Println(sumClosure(1)) // 1
    fmt.Println(sumClosure(2)) // 3
    fmt.Println(sumClosure(3)) // 6
}
```

In this example:

- The `adder` function returns a closure that increments the `sum` variable.
- The `sum` variable is captured by the closure and persists between function calls.

### Example 2: Multiple Closures

Each closure has its own copy of the captured variables:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    adder := func() func(int) int {
        sum := 0
        return func(x int) int {
            sum += x
            return sum
        }
    }

    closure1 := adder()
    closure2 := adder()

    fmt.Println(closure1(5)) // 5
    fmt.Println(closure1(10)) // 15

    fmt.Println(closure2(7)) // 7
    fmt.Println(closure2(3)) // 10
}
```

Here, `closure1` and `closure2` maintain independent states.

### Practical Use Case: Generating Unique IDs

Closures are useful for maintaining state in scenarios like generating unique IDs:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func idGenerator() func() int {
    id := 0
    return func() int {
        id++
        return id
    }
}

func main() {
    generateID := idGenerator()

    fmt.Println(generateID()) // 1
    fmt.Println(generateID()) // 2
    fmt.Println(generateID()) // 3
}
```

### When to Use Closures:

1. When you need to maintain state between function calls.
2. For implementing callback-like behavior or encapsulated logic.
3. For creating factory functions or generating unique functionality.
