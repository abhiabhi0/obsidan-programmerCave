#### Reduced Runtime Errors and Simplified the CI/CD Pipeline

- **What it Means:**
    - **Static Typing:** Goâ€™s type system enforces variable types at compile time, catching errors before runtime. This minimized bugs due to type mismatches, making the codebase more robust and easier to refactor.
    - **Single Binary Deployment:** Go compiles all dependencies and code into a single executable file, eliminating runtime dependencies like libraries or language runtimes (e.g., Ruby interpreters). This streamlined deployments and reduced environment-specific issues.
- **Benefits:**
    - **Error Reduction:** Fewer bugs make it to production.
    - **Simpler CI/CD Pipeline:** No need to manage multiple runtime dependencies. This made containerization easier and deployments more predictable.
